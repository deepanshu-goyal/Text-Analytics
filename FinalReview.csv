Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,Best ride.,"I brought Seltos HTX one week back. This is my 6th car following Innova Crysta, XUV500, Duster, Honda City, and Dzire. I can safely say that this is the best overall car in this price range presently. This car is a near-perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are amazing, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my Innova Crysta. Diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. The back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. Boot space has enough space for the luggage of five people for a short trip. I drove this vehicle on really ugly Bhokar-Nanded road of Maharashtra (bad would be a word for this road at present which I think) and I can assure you that , this vehicle has one of the best ride quality which can be easily comparable to my Innova Crysta in terms of ride quality. Seltos is breeze to drive. I drove the petrol GT line also for short distances, and it is also a great variant to own. You can go for either variant as per your needs and choice. Both variants are great. Diesel is giving me 17kmpl overall at present for 60% highway and 40% city drive with AC 100% on. I hope, mileage will definitely increase after the second service(oil change) to 19Kmpl overall. A smart air purifier with perfume diffuser is an added advantage. AC is powerful and works fantastically.

Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,Best car of the year,"Getting into and out of the Seltos is easy and what is sure to impress is the sheer level of quality in the interior; material quality and fit-finish are up there with pricier European cars. The dashboard is neatly laid out and usefully places the infotainment system high up and in the driver?s line of sight. Top-spec Seltos? get slick 10.2-inch touchscreens, the instrument cluster is easy to read and there?s even head-up display. A powered driver?s seat, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, a 360-degree parking camera, and even an onboard air purifier are other features offered on the Seltos. Front seat comfort is good but the rear seat does lose some points for the somewhat lack of thigh support. While not the roomiest of SUVs for the price, the Seltos offers plenty of space and features like a retractable backrest and retractable sun visors also enhance the rear seat experience.  While we are yet to try out all engine-gearbox options on offer, we did come away very impressed with the 1.5 diesel-manual and the 1.4 turbo-petrol autos. The 115hp diesel is very refined and performance is pleasant. A slick gearbox and a well-weighted clutch also make it easy to live with. Those looking for a sporty drive will find a good match in the 140hp, 1.4 turbo-petrol. The engine is smooth, strong and very likable. Also good is the 7-speed dual-clutch auto that is responsive and quick to shift. What's missing are paddle shifters.  The Kia Seltos is easy to drive. The steering requires reasonable effort and weights up well enough at higher speeds. Ride comfort is good too with nice low-speed bump absorption and confident high-speed manners",5,Suraj Yadav,17-Nov-19,1504,1,0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/best-car-of-the-year-93899.htm

Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,Kia seltos above all,"One of the most futuristic-looking cars, in my opinion, it's better than MG Hector or the Tata Harrier, Seltos gives a very punchy performance and the power delivery is very linear you just have to press the gas pedal and the rpm meter goes right up to the 5000 rpm, mark it gives an excellent performance, hats off to Kia motors. The Kia Seltos is the 3rd car in India after Hyundai Venue and MG Hector to get a connected tech called UVO meaning your voice and has 37 features. The UVO app can be used to control functions like remote engine start/ stop, door lock/ unlock, voice based commands and remote vehicle status among others. Kia has partnered with Vodafone to provide connectivity solutions along with many other tech companies like MapMyIndia and LG. Move inside the cabin and you will be taken aback by the design and layout. There are a variety of trim options right from an all-black theme to dual tone and more. The overall layout remains the same with a cockpit inspired design. The highlight, of course, is the large horizontally placed 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system that's intuitive to operate. The system adjoins the instrument cluster having a 7-inch digital display and looks modern, not only the Seltos is feature-rich, but it's also mechanically rich. Kia has added a variety of engine and gearbox options in the Seltos to cater a wide audience and growing demand of the buyers. To be precise, there are 3 engine options and four gearbox options combined to form 16 variant options. The one we drove during our first-drive review was the 1.5-litre diesel engine with an automatic gearbox. Before talking about the driving experience, here's a brief idea about the engine options. There's a 1.5-litre petrol engine developing 115 PS and 144 Nm output mated to either a 6-speed manual or a CVT gearbox. There's the 1.5-litre diesel with 115 PS and 250 Nm output mated to a 6-speed manual and 6- speed automatic unit, the one which got to drive. And lastly, the talk of the town 1.4-litre turbo petrol producing 140 PS and 242 Nm and is mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed DCT. All the engines are BS-VI ready. There are 3 drive modes - Normal, Eco and Sport and three traction modes - Mud, Snow and Sand to choose from, however, there's no physical knob to easily opt between these modes. There's no all-wheel drive system either. Talking about the drive experience, the diesel engine had a minimal turbo lag with a linear delivery and a very good low-end torque. The auto gearbox responded well with the engine and it was not difficult doing three digit speeds even on narrow Goan roads. The flat-bottom steering not only felt good to hold but also had balanced feedback for city and highway driving. It was not difficult to take sharp turns, though it felt a bit heavier at times. The ride quality was fabulous and it felt like Kia had worked hard to tune suspension as per the Indian roads. We took the car through water clogged roads, broken patches and highway and the Seltos did not disappoint us. The NVH levels were refined and no diesel clutter or instant acceleration noise seeped inside the cabin. The braking was confident too, and heavy rains didn't affect the braking force much. In terms of mileage, Kia claims 16+ kilometres to a litre for both the petrol engines and 21 kmpl for the diesel engine with a manual gearbox.",5,Xczxzcc,10-Aug-19,12084,12,5,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/kia-seltos-above-all-77484.htm

Cardekho.com,Kia Seltos,Marvellous & Rocking SUV,"Based on my onscreen review, one of the best SUV to hit the market with its maiden entry into the Indian market. As the images and video reveals it has everything that Creta lacks as far as exterior design is concerned especially the rear view. A big but well designed SUV Seltos touches deep to my heart with marvelous front, beating the MG Hector, heart touching rear beating the Hyundai Creta and the boot space, ground clearance, length, breadth, height, and power is almost same as that of XUV500, MG Hector and Tata Harrier. But it is the pricing that matters in the Indian market. Price it properly to avoid the undesired results as it happened in case of Jeep Compass. Trust me the Indians will compromise with safety features but not with design and pricing. Believe me, this SUV is going to rock the market with the sporty design but pricing that worries me. Don't forget what is happening to Jeep Compass as it is priced beyond the buyer's expectations. In the end best of luck to Kia, a sister company of Hyundai to compete not only with its brother Hyundai but also with all the SUVs currently available in the Indian market.",4,Sukhjinder Singh,26-Jun-19,60,1,0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/kia-seltos/marvellous-rocking-suv-68334.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,This car fulfils everything in 20 budget.,"I drove MG Hector (Sharp) Petrol Hybrid for more than 1000kms. Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for drivers/passengers. HiTech features make you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Overall I am very happy. After driving it on different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""underpowered."" The fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,It is a very cool car,"The length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. The 17-inch wheels also look a size too small. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention. The MG's cabin is simply cavernous and there is plenty of space for five passengers and their luggage. Range-topping versions get a massive panoramic sunroof that only adds to the airy feel in the interior. There are lots of other goodies onboard and the features really are a draw in their own right. The much talked about a 10.4-inch touchscreen that comes armed with connectivity tech is the focal point on the dashboard. Material quality is largely good but you will find some less special bits in the interior as well. The MG Hector Diesel is 170 HP, 2.0-liter engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, packs enough grunt and impresses with its linear power delivery and refinement. A snappy clutch remains a pain point of the Fiat-sourced engine though. The MG Hector Petrol gets a 143 HP, 1.5-liter turbocharged unit with a 6-speed manual as standard and a 48 V mild-hybrid setup as an option. The petrol hybrid is easy-going but lacks oomph for quick overtakes. The dual-clutch transmission does add convenience to the package but it's not the slickest of gearboxes. The ride quality is fairly good at town speeds, but up the pace, and you'll get a fair bit of body movement on undulating surfaces. The MG doesn't feel as well tied down as rivals at triple-digit speeds either and the noticeable body roll also means it simply isn't a driver's car. The steering isn't the most fearsome but it is light at low speeds and makes it easy to maneuver the large SUV.",5,Brij Bhushan Katoch,20-Nov-19,750,0,2,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/it-is-a-very-cool-car-94123.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,Amazing Car,"I own a petrol hybrid MG Hector and the experience has been amazing to date. Have completed 2k kms. 1. The engine : sufficient power for this sized car. I initially thought the power to weight ratio would be evident when it comes to pulling the car, but I haven't experienced lack of power in most scenarios. The noise and vibrations are so low that sometime you wouldn't even know if the car is switched ON. 2. Driveability : light steering & clutch plus smooth gear transmission, it's an amazing combination to have especially if you drive a lot in the city. On the highway the steering doesn't feel very light, so you have sufficient control over the vehicle. Around the corners there definitely is the trademark SUV crossover bodyroll. If you are sitting in the rear seat, then you can be assured that you are sitting in the most comfortable space which you wouldn't get in any car. 3. Fuel efficiency: 6th gear and 80-120kms is the sweet spot for this car. Put it in this range and ull set records with the mileage. Mine clocks 19-21 km/L in this range. Within city under heavy traffic conditions I get 7-9km/L. 4. Infotainment system: a lot have complained on the sluggishness of the system, and even I felt the system to be slow. The latest update has fixed this issue. The system is smoother now. With a USB connected you can view photos and videos as well. 5. Space and overall comfort: the hector scores a 11/10 over here.. 10/ 10 with the sunroof closed and 11 with an open sunroof. Overall this is an awesome car in this segment and should be an obvious pick for anyone who is looking out to by am SUV crossover between 15 to 23Lakhs on-road price.",5,Anonymous,6-Oct-19,14300,10,4,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-car-88851.htm

I love the front of the car but at the back, it looks like an Audi as it has been given an Audi like finish. The second row is very spacious and it feels very airy due to its panoramic sunroof and its large windows can never make a person claustrophobic.

At L1 (coolest) setting and at an ambient temperature of fewer than 35 degrees, it was uncomfortable inside the car. 3. The pick-up is very poor. Even on a small slope, and at low gear (2 or 3), the car struggles to move. 4. Many of the so-called ""high tech"" features do not work.

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,Superb Car: MG Hector,"Hello, this is just a review after doing 4000 km on diesel top-end variant. I will not get into looks and interiors as so many people have written on it. I would just focus on my 4000 km travel experience. Did hill as well as national and state highway driving? Touched 170 km/h speed. Car is excellent to drive and braking at high-speed is fantastic. No vibration or sitting while breaking, just stops straight. On the bridge, joints do not jump or shake. Would rate it better than a Fortuner or Q5 which I have driven on some roads (Lucknow to Delhi). Hill driving did between Kanpur and shaktinagar. On hill, I find the car has less power especially when u change gears. The car has a perfect grip on hill turns. The car gave me an average fuel consumption of 18 between Kanpur and shaktinagar. Very comfortable seats just don't feel tired. Everything was perfect except for two issues. 1. headlights need improvement as on rainy night visibility gets bad. 2. Wiper blades need some improvement as it leaves some foggy impression on the glass for a second.",5,Sameer Bhargava,6-Aug-19,13469,50,7,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/superb-car-mg-hector-76699.htm

It gives good power. wheel spin is controlled, but I noticed one issue that space (gap) between the clutch pedal and the dead pedal is low its bit discomfort for the driver. the suspension is supreme but doesn't know the condition at corners. Music system (infinity) is supreme, but the white cloth-like cover for the sunroof has no quality. The wheel size could be better. the instrument cluster is not up to the mark. Other wise its a nice car waiting for a face lift of this model.",4,Fasil Sha S,1-Aug-19,10757,5,0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/the-showoff-car-75658.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,Battery issue will be the biggest issue.,"MG Hector is one of the best SUVs in this segment. MG has basically competition with harrier and compass. I had driven this SUV so I am sharing my experience. Pros: 1. SUV has a good pickup. 2. Smooth drive.  Cons:1. Issue with the voice command. Either the voice command did not respond or it will listen to your personal talk too. 2. Display touch: Touch is not that much responding as expected. one can say that Touch is the same as in Chinese mobile. 3. cooling issue: Rear seat passenger is going to face this issue in Hot weather. Rear vent cooling is not as per the expectations. Due to the sunroof, rear seats have a much higher temperature. 4. The biggest issue which the one will face is the battery issue. Even MG knows that its battery is not that much perfect that's why MG is giving a 1-year warranty on the battery.",3,Vikas Dixit,22-Jul-19,37273,69,19,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/battery-issue-will-be-the-biggest-issue-73530.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,All About MG - Hector,"MG Hector is a huge hit in India. Booking numbers are over 15,000 units in about 15 days post launch. Waiting period in most cities has touched 7 months, and increasing. With production of Hector limited to just 2,000 units a month, it is going to be a long wait for most buyers. The good news is that deliveries have started, and are in full swing Just like the Hector, there is another SUV which is all set for India launch, that has managed to garner a similar kind of buzz; and that is the Kia Seltos. With all the details about Kia Seltos now available, it is time to take a look at both MG Hector and Kia Seltos specs on paper. MG Hector and Kia Seltos are both equipped with connected car technologies, come in with an array for first in segment features and brim over with driver and passenger conveniences and comforts. They are both well equipped in terms of safety and both receive powerful engine lineup. The MG Hector is officially launched in India whereas the Kia Seltos is slated for launch on 22nd August 2019. Despite their similarities, there are some vital differences which are detailed below; Exterior Design and Features ? MG Hector is offered in four trims ? Style, Super, Smart and Sharp and color schemes of Candy White, Aurora Silver, Glaze Red, Starry Black and Burgundy Red. It boasts of a tall stance and commanding road presence. It is fitted with a large front grille with extensive use of chrome in its makeup, all LED lamps at the front and rear and side indicators along with silver finished skid plates, 17? dual tone alloy wheels and squared wheel arches. The silver finished roof rails and large panoramic sunroof enhance its sporty appeal along with chrome elements at the rear and a chrome bar that is positioned above the license plate. Dimensions ? MG Hector boasts of larger dimensions as compared to the Kia Seltos even though both are compact SUVs. The Hector stands 4,655mm in length, 1,835mm in width and 1,760mm in height. It gets a wheelbase of 2,750mm. On the other hand, the Kia Seltos stands distinctively shorter in length at 4,315mm while width is at 1,800mm, height at 1,620mm and wheelbase at 2,610mm. These dimensions could mean that the cabin of the Seltos would be a bit cramped as compared to that seen on the Hector while boot space will also be more spacious in the Hector as compared to that of the Seltos. Interior Features, Safety and Technology ? Interiors of the MG Hector boast of a neat design. The seats are comfortable and well bolstered with contouring for better passenger comforts and done up in soft touch upholstery in contrasting leather. The 10.4? full HD touchscreen sees fewer buttons. There are piano black inserts seen on the central console with grey accents on the dashboard enhancing its premium appeal. Where safety is concerned, compliance to new safety norms bring in electronic stability program, hill assist, cruise control, powered seats and 360 degree camera, rear parking sensors, 6 airbags, ABS and EBD as standard. MG Hector is the first connected compact SUV to launch in India. It woos tech savvy buyers in India with its array of advanced in-car technologies for which the company has linked up with global tech partners such as like Microsoft, Adobe, SAP, Cisco, Nuance, Gaana, TomTom and Unlimit. This car also receives Internet Protocol version 6, making it 5G ready and the e-SIM is provided by Airtel and MG Motors offering internet connectivity for the complete warranty period. Kia Seltos also commands well designed interiors with comfortable seating, an 8 speaker sound system from Bose, a first in segment 10.25? touchscreen infotainment system and a 7? color TFT unit for the instrument console. There is a bounty of safety features offered on the Kia Seltos. These include ABS, EBD, ECS, 6 airbags, traction control, stability management, hill start assist, brake assist, front and rear parking cameras and a 360 degree camera for all round visibility. The occupant cell has been designed for maximum protection in the event of a crash with high steel and deformation zones to absorb impact. Kia calls its connected technology as UVO which can be accessed via a smartphone. It offers a total of 37 connectivity features with roadside assistance and SOS to alert a call center in the event of an emergency. Price ? MG Hector is priced between Rs.12.18 lakhs and Rs.16.88 lakhs. Kia has not yet disclosed pricing of the upcoming Seltos which could be offered in a much lower price bracket starting from as low as Rs.11 lakhs going up to Rs.16 lakhs for the top end variant.",4,We Punjabi Music,12-Jul-19,33,0,0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/all-about-mg-hector-72013.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,AMAZING JOURNEY AHEAD...,"What's it like on the outside? The Hector is certainly a head-turner and it drew quite an audience everywhere and every time we stopped for photos on the picturesque route from Coimbatore to Coonoor. The nose has lots of interesting detailing and follows the current trend where the headlight cluster is placed down at bumper level with the LED DRLs sitting above where the lights typically should be. The humongous grille, which you just can?t miss, feels a touch oversized, even on a car so big though. The blade-like DRLs further accentuate the size of the grille and look great when illuminated. There's a good dose of chrome, of course, used liberally around the grille, and C-shaped headlight housings. The prominent air intake in the lower bumper and massive skid plate look the part and give the Hector serious SUV credibility.",5,Annmay Kadve,2-Jul-19,192,0,0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/amazing-journey-ahead-69841.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,Strong Competitor for Vehicles in its Class.,"By looking at the specifications and features, MG Hector seems to be a strong contender in its segment. It excels in every department be it engine, features, design, space. It comes with many segment-first features like an internet-based vertically mounted 10.4 inches infotainment system, a full panoramic sunroof, connected car features, etc that make it more appealing to the Indian consumer. Apart from features, MG Hector is also very well equipped in terms of safety. Safety features like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, traction control, all four disc brakes, hill hold assist, and ISOFIX child seat mounts are stand across the range. Only if MG can price the Hector aggressively, somewhere between 15-20 Lakh then I think it will be a value for money option for buyers in the segment. As MG is a new brand in the Indian automotive market, it will be interesting to see how MG handles the sale and service of its vehicles. To me, MG Hector seems to be a solid competitor to other vehicles in its segment. It seems to be a sensible choice for someone who is looking to buy a well built and feature-rich SUV under 20 Lakhs. Only time will tell how well the MG brand performs in the Indian automotive market.",5,Anonymous,5-Jun-19,26,0,0,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/mg-hector/strong-competitor-for-vehicles-in-its-class-62633.htm

Cardekho.com,MG Hector,Extraordinary car In Indian Market.,"When I hear that car is coming to India which will be the first Indian electric SUV, I am surprised about that. This car's look is not so crispy as much as Tata's harrier, but it damns electric beast. This car doesn't shine us, this car speaks to us. Every Indian should purchase all car from MG brands only even though they are Chinese owned, reason that MG is an electric car. At least Indian pollution will be reduced instead of Globalisation of car trading across the world. If Tesla comes to Indian Market it will take 250% more import charge as much as 85 lakh rupees for just 25 lakh rupees tesla in the US states. Hats off to China for doing something changes to Indian environment. The reason why I am supporting China. Indians don't have the hope to produce own electric car even they are electrical engineers and the other hand government don't provide fund for an electric vehicle startup project. They don't care about success. But MG does. It provides their SUV not sedan in just between 15 to 20 lakh. I hope I may be the first customer. Thinking you.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Good SUV But Engine Makes Lot Of Noises,"Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV.

Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6.

I was driving Jeep Compass with my friend at a speed of about 80 to 100 km/hr on this freeway suddenly my right side front Tyre faced a problem and the car was going to its right side at same speed I tried to control it and pulled my steering towards left side and the car struck to a divider and the impact was so strong that I, my Friend and the Car all were upside down. It slid about 150 meters. Due to Seat belt on me and my friend were safe with injuries on the chest. The main thing after the accident is that I called Jeep 24/7 Customer Care, The other problem was that due to this high impact accident and the car was upside down but the Air-Bags didn't open at all and so I was seriously hurt on my chest.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Petrol driking Mechine ( Avrage 5-6km/l),"My name is Johnson Correya and I currently reside in Powai (Mumbai). I have purchased a petrol model Jeep Compass Sports Variant with Manual Transmission. Before buying the vehicle, I had checked reviews on different websites about this vehicle and discussed the features with the sales team, especially with the salesperson from the Landmark Mumbai showroom (Abhishek). All automobile related sites and the salesman had claimed that the mileage for this model is 14-17 km/liter. I don't have any other problems with this model except the mileage for which I am getting an average of 5 to 5.5 km/liter with a mixture of conditions like traffic, without traffic and high way etc. I approached the CRM Mr. Salim who asked me to bring the car for a check-up. I dropped the vehicle off on 14/11/18 after completing 1200 km. I had reset the meter just before I dropped the vehicle at the service center. Service adviser Prateek attended my vehicle and suggested me to come back after 3 days as they wanted to test the entire vehicle. I complied and collected the vehicle after 3 days had elapsed. While I was collecting the vehicle, he informed me that they had checked the vehicle in traffic conditions and they had gotten 10 km/liter with no other technical issues in the vehicle. They have written the average mileage as 10 km/liter in the service form. I checked the mileage meter just after leaving the service center then I realized that the mileage was 4.5km/liter and they have driven the vehicle 14.5 km. It was a barefaced lie which they told me that they got 10 km/liter in traffic conditions. I had informed the mileage issue to the CRM (Salim) again. He had suggested that he would send one person with me to check my driving pattern. He had sent Aditya Dhere on 23.11.18 at 6 pm at my office. He accompanied me for 2 km in traffic conditions. He understood that the issue is with the mileage and not with my driving patterns. He had taken a picture of the mileage meter and sent it to the CRM. We got 2.2 km/liter for around 2 km drive with 25 minutes of travel. I don't travel always in traffic, 5-5.5 is an average of a mix (all conditions). It is not worth driving this vehicle with the kind of average I get and why the company is offering an impossible mileage of 14-17 km/liter is ludicrous and preposterous. They haven't given any solution till date. My humble request to the customers, please do not buy Jeep compass as they are selling the car with fake commitments.",1,Johnson,17-Jan-19,98,28,1,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/petrol-driking-mechine-avrage-56kml-27871.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Jeep Compass My Experience After Driving 3000Kms,"We are a family of four and we all are really fond of cars including my little one 2 years old as well. The elder 10 year old son can rattle the power and torque figures of different cars. Most of the cars we have owned are driving oriented and we always take the build quality, driving dynamics and safety as top priorities every time we choose a new car. Just to name the cars in our fleet in the past, we owned Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, Skoda Yeti and Laura. All these cars gave brilliant experience with well sorted performance. But choosing the Yeti successor was quite a difficult task as the list of priorities increased all these years. We shortlisted the priorities which included nice driving dynamics, strong build quality and safety, leather steering wheel, leather seats, silent/powerful diesel engine, spaciousness, distinct styling and of course, the hill hold control since I have phobia of rolling back. So, fortunately we were able to shortlist the cars and the list included Renault Duster, Audi Q3, BMW X1, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Tiguan and Jeep Compass. The Audi and BMW were rejected due to fact that our regular drives to the outskirts where my grandparents live would prove a nightmare for these cars. Skoda Kodiaq and VW Tiguan were outrageously priced for what they offer while we listed out Renault Duster because it lacks adequate safety features. So, the last option remained in the list which was meeting all our expectations was Jeep Compass. Now coming to the initial experience, man, it's a head turner. Wherever I take my blazing red Jeep Compass, it really grabs eyeballs. It has pretty striking similarity with the Range Rover Evoque, especially the blackened roof. My wife is really smitten with this car, during the early drive of 40 kms, we drove equally for 30 kilometers. The car is exceptionally comfortable to drive with the engine barely audible from inside even if you cruise at the speed of 80kmph. The 2.0L engine produces 173PS and 350Nm of peak torque with the SUV giving above 16kmpl mileage in mix conditions which is pretty much acceptable given the stature of the car. With linear acceleration, the vehicle can reach the 80-90kmph mark in no time. The engine is quite smooth and does not have turbo lag unlike other cars we owned in the past. Coming to the part which I liked the most is the robust quality this car comes with. It is heavy especially the doors, hood and the tailgate. The car comes with all the safety aspects which we needed including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill start assist, electronic parking brake and ISOFIX rear child seat mounts. The braking is adequate and it comes to halt in the straight line without any fuss. In terms of comfort inside, the car is an absolute bliss with enough legroom at the rear which most people complain about in the car. The car has all the contemporary gizmos including the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto support and a very effective air conditioner. However, the sound output from the AV system was mediocre although one can always add extra speakers to increase the decibels. Driven over 3000kms so far and it has been a wonderful experience with this car. Anyone who wants a little show-off with utter cabin comfort, safety and smooth engine performance, I think Jeep Compass can be a good choice under Rs. 25 lakhs.",5,Shailendra,19-Nov-18,191,19,4,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-my-experience-after-driving-3000kms-21737.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Jeep Compass - Attractive Design and Amazing Performance,"Jeep Compass as the name strikes the mind, we get the image of the hardcore off-road Jeep-like vehicle but that?s not the case with the Jeep Compass. Though it?s a plush as well as off-roader it dons the typical city SUV looks. I bought my Jeep Compass in January 2018 and till date, it never failed to impress me in one way or the other. Its amazing performance and features are quite inspiring while its exterior and interior looks make one give a second glance for sure. Jeep Compass was first introduced in July 2017 in the Indian subcontinent making it as a strong player against other compact SUVs in this space. The vehicle was designed to look like a baby Grand Cherokee and gets some of the features from Jeep Renegade. The SUV features vertically slatted wide radiator grille, muscular front bumper, and high mounted headlamps. Side profile gets the prominent shoulder line and squared wheel arches while the rear portion is neatly finished. Inside, the first thing that catches the eye is the Uconnect infotainment unit that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay placed at the center of the dashboard. The car also gets dual-zone automatic temperature control and seats are covered with Ski grey leather upholstery. For better safety, Jeep Compass comes loaded with numerous features such as dual front airbags, traction control, ABS and EBD. I own the powerful diesel engine that is the 2.0L motor that belts out 173PS of power and mated to six-speed manual gearbox. The car possesses mature suspension setup, nicely-tuned EPS & rock-solid stability that translate to excellent drivability. So, Jeep Compass is leading the way in practical and finest design and delivers the perfect driving experience. The car is well priced for what it offers. So if you are the one who loves the attractive design under reasonable pricing along with tough build, quality cabin, and genuine driving experience, then nothing is left to ignore this piece of machine.",5,Rishi,27-Apr-18,195,16,7,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-attractive-design-and-amazing-performance-19459.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Arrogant Staff Will Sink Jeep Compass,"I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales personI first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn't have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer. I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer. I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint ......""I cant say prices will increase etc........"" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off The product is very good, but this is not the end. But arrogant people like this waiting to I have to go to these kind of people for service for the rest of the vehicles life. It is very difficult to do that after today's experince. When they can renege on their word today, they will do it every day.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Great Car with great service,"I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied. Till now I have driven around 3350 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour. I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams. As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good. Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly. I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call. I am happy with my choice.

As we drove down the highways, the car felt well planted and I didn?t have to switch gears very frequently in order to keep the car moving, which made it pretty relaxing to drive. But when we came back in the city, the heavy clutch started to get irritating and painful. The infotainment system offered with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will not disappoint you but it would have been better if it had a large screen in place. I quite liked the car and I would like to get one myself but the unavailability of an automatic transmission is a deal breaker for me.

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,4x4 MT Compass (21.39 L) vs the AWD AT Tucson (25.18 L),"As and when Compass comes with AT 4x4 it will cost atleast 23.5 and obviously as it is a new launch there are no discount offers. Tucson with discount offers between 1-1.5 L is going to be available for almost the same price as the AT 4x4 Compass. Therefore a Tucson which is bigger, more powerful, more fuel efficient, better dynamically designed, more reliable, better ASS network, better looking ( depends on ones own taste), drives more like a sedan ( most of ones driving is going to be on metalled roads), needs serious considerations.As far as brand value (snob value ) is concerned worldwide Hyundai sells more Tucson than Jeep selling compass and has better ratings.In fact Jeep products are at the bottom of the rung. Now the present compass may be a new vehicle and may behave differently but it is still untested. A short test drive is not enough to test a vehicle which is going to cost more than 25 L.",,,,,,,
Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Jeep Compass Attractive SUV That Misses Some Key Features,"I started following all the updates on this small SUV the moment it was announced for the Indian market. The key reason behind purchasing this car was the attractive design with which I fell in love at the first sight. And since it is a Jeep product, I wasn't caring much about the build quality and the driving experience. The ride and handling of the Jeep Compass certainly make it a true blue SUV, especially the high-speed stability and the way suspension gulps the potholes is beyond words. But honestly, this SUV is not perfect. The car is not spacious given its size. It also lacks some key features that should have been integrated by Jeep such as sunroof, auto headlights, cruise control and rain sensing wipers. So in my opinion, Jeep should address these issues asap since parent company Fiat does not have a good reputation in terms of sales and services. Although Jeep is giving 2 years/unlimited kms warranty on the car to encourage the buyers, still a lot more effort is needed from the company to turn the tables to its side.",3,Ravinder,13-Feb-18,401,31,1,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-attractive-suv-that-misses-some-key-features-19034.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Jeep Compass a great value for money SUV...,"Good to be back again?this time I am writing a review for the Jeep Compass Longitude Diesel MT. This is the mid segment jeep in the compass series. To start with let me tell you the vehicle is absolutely ?SOLID? heavy build and gives you an impeccable presence wherever you go. So lets talk engine dynamics, the diesel engine of this baby is a 2 Ltr Multijet diesel engine meshed with a 6 speed gear box yielding 173 PS power which is sufficient to propel this vehicle really fast. The acceleration is good but the pickup still might need some work. It can be blamed on the heavy build of the vehicle as the engine after all is 2 ltr. The breaking is pretty efficient as I did try the odd ball 60 KM/HR to ?0? breaking and the vehicle responded perfectly telling me that the ABS and EBD systems gelled perfectly. Let?s talk driving comfort now, although the gear shifts are smooth but the clutch does require some pushing and in city driving you might get a bit of a foot ache if you are not used to it. The vehicle can power down if you are at a low speed trying to drive at a higher gear. One thing I really loved was the electronic parking brake which replaced a hand brake with a nifty little button where the hand brake used to exist. Now coming to the ergonomics on this vehicle, the instrument cluster is well lit and the infotainment system has just the right features. I bought the Longitude and not the optional so features like car play and android auto were not available. They did provide a usb port in the rear which was pretty good. There were a couple of things which did disappoint like there was no climatronic AC, although the door handled has leathered upholstery the seats were fabric which was very disappointing and the Jeep accessory for the seat costed about 16000 MRP. The car has reverse parking sensors but no camera which is not one would expect after paying a good amount for this car and lets face it, it doesn?t cost much. Another things which was painful was that the car?s speaker system was absolutely flat no zing to it. The car does have traction control but not sure how much of that you would use. In summary the car is excellent in terms of handling and well grounded, the features are there but for the price I paid I expected much more. Overall, if you would really like a Jeep with all the bells and whistled go for a Longitude Optional or Limited. Happy and safe driving.",4,Samriddh Mangotra,27-Dec-17,241,25,10,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-a-great-value-for-money-suv-18826.htm

Cardekho.com,Jeep Compass,Jeep Compass- Unbelievably Affordable,"I have been a huge fan of Jeep badge. The sturdy and macho vehicles that this American brand manufactures are simply unmatchable. I have been following the Jeep Compass since the time it was first showcased. The massive road presence and the sharp styling of the Compass SUV cannot be compared to any other crossover in the country. Apart from this, its tyres will get your heart racing, they are just fantastic.The crossover is fully loaded but the biggest surprise came in the form of the price. Just Rs 14.95 lakh! I am amazed with Jeep's pricing strategy, it undercuts almost all its rivals and is definitely here to rule the Indian automotive arena. The other plus points of the Compass is the availability in both the petrol and diesel engines. Another important bit of the Jeep SUV is the Jeep Active Drive 4x4 system which disconnects rear axle and effortlessly keeps on switching between 4x2 and 4x4 drive types to ensure one gets the 4x4 capability only when it's essential, thus saving the extra effort of the vehicle. I am sure it must be helping out on the fuel efficiency numbers as well. With the Compass, a new beast of performance is here. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will be watching how the sales of the Compass take off. However, the more critical aspect is how Jeep is able to tackle the after-sales service of the Compass in a country obsessed with 'cheap and best' philosophy.",5,Micheal Verified Buyer,31-Jul-17,10979,123,48,https://www.cardekho.com/user-review/jeep-compass/jeep-compass-unbelievably-affordable-18366.htm

The sound system is amazing but I can't say the same for the infotainment display. Yes, it has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility but there's a noticeable lag in its operation. I have bought the 2.0-litre Limited variant without the 4x4 system. Up until now, I am more than satisfied with the Compass. But as I mentioned above, there are some drawbacks.

From the driver's seat, it feels as if you're sitting in a vehicle of Creta's size. After sitting in the Compressed, sorry Compass, I felt that the starting price of around Rs 15 lakh is fair, and not very aggressive. Also, considering the reliability issues with the brand in most other markets, even if you are saving some money upfront, it'll be used up on the SUV only, and may not count as savings. There were a lot of people out there to check the Compass in the dealership and it looks like it will sell in good numbers. But I think I'll wait to see how Jeep fares in the after-sales department.

Carwale.com,Kia Seltos,,"Kia seltos is no doubt a very good car in its segment but is it really worth that price? 
Has it priced it logically in a weak automobile market ? Is it worth paying premium for BS 6 diesel engines well before rules come in ?
Why not buy other cars with best service network and great deals which will be more sweeter with GST cuts in few weeks ?

Kia has opened pre bookings very early to see the demand. And seeing Indian customers' interest in seltos, it has priced the base (useless) variant below 10 lakhs to fool us. And other variants (which are worth buying) are priced high. If you look at pricing, base petrol and diesel variant differ by 30k only but all other variants have price difference of 1-1.2 lakhs. Few more fooling techniques adopted by kia :
They created HT and GT lines to confuse customers and force us to buy costly variants.
Top HTX plus doesnt get even safety features of GTX plus, leave alone few fancy features.
AT is priced 1 lakh more than its respective variant, but no safety features are given as bonus (other car makers do that).
DCT technology is new and it is tried on us , that too with premium pricing.
Top variants of diesel AT and petrol DCT are priced same and also the base diesel and petrol MT are closely priced, but in between they are
differing by 1-1.2 lakhs. 

Summary is that we all are at fault, since we have shown interest in seltos well before launch and pre-booked in large numbers. This has given kia (the new entrant) the confidence to price their models on higher side , even when automobile industry is facing biggest slump. Once crazy emotions come down for Indian customers, reality will sink in their minds and people will analyse closely the premium they are paying unnecessarily. 
It is not any hot cake that will be unavailable if you don't rush and buy now.

Otherwise how dare a new comer company shall take Indian customers for ride and happily cashing in on their confusion, when all other car makers are reeling under pressure of slowdown. 
I have also booked this car, but I am not convinced to buy and take delivery for this same reason. HTX plus AT is wrongly over priced and it is same with few more variants. Why pay so much premium for untested car and company in a discounted market. This is my personal view.

I have been riding my seltos for almost a month now, but its give lots of happiness.  Looks are so aggressive and futuristic,  very less engine noise with BS6 engine.  Interior of this car is also superb dont feel any cost cutting at any part, although highlight is 8"" touch screen infotainment system.  Overall great feature in this price along with a big SUV car. I m getting 12 kmpl average in city ride. And approx 16 to 17 kmpl on highway ride with my petrol manual variant.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I bought my Jeep compass(Diesel, 4X2) two months back and within few days of purchase, I have observed a high level of rattling sound from the engine. Sound was so irritating and often happens while accelerating at 2nd and 3rd gears and sound vanishes when accelerate further and  gets past 2000. Finally, I have observed that engine making rattling only when it is  starts from cold start condition and it persists nearly one hour. To my great greatest surprise, it was found that rattling noise vanishes when the engine stop and start again. I have demonstrated the problem to the dealer and they are now taking up the matter with manufacturer. I am looking forward for the action from Jeep.
Ride Quality & Handling Good.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Before I start the detailed review, let me express a concern over the genuinity of the reviews posted by people who don't own the vehicle. For those who go by cumulative rating, 3.5 stars seems way too less. But the fact is that some of the disgruntled users who had issues with dealerships had a major hand in the same.
When Jeep Compass released in India, it was crearly 1 segment above my reach from my 2011 Toyota Etios G Petrol. I had hardly driven 40K in 7 years and was absolutely in love with driving comfort of my vehicle. I had to go for a segment upgrade and was searching for a 7 seater and then Jeep happened.
The thought of owning a premium truly international SUV at that price tag, made me jump one segment higher and even moved me away from 7 seater segment. I got the vehicle booked under my employer's lease plan - but changed the booking in my name at the last moment due to some reason. Result, I had no waiting that seems to be the biggest concern here.
I got the vehicle delivered on Jan 7th 2018 - Minimal Grey (I had the roof painted black for 20 K from showroom, which I feel is worth every paisa).
Exterior The Black roof gave the machine a range roversque look and I was the first in my firm to own one. To put it briefly, it made me famous - very famous. Everyone knew the guy who had the Jeep. The build quality was evident when I had an accident where the left front wheel arch and left side view mirror went under a National Permit Lorry while attempting a risky overtaking maneuver. Had it been any other vehicle, the left side view mirror would have shattered. Here, it simply folded and resumed all relectronic functionality once retracted. The wheel arch suffered a minor dent, which was fixed off-show room for a nominal expense.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Features:
All safety features that Jeep offers are premium and have experienced the traction control, ECS,HSA and ABS in real time. Fortunately there was no need for Air-bag deployment. Worth the money! The Uconnect entertainment system easily paired Apple phones via Apple Car Play butyou can have multiple devices paired, including Android. There are two USB charging points one in the front and one in the rear. Air Conditioning is efficient with both front and rear vents. Once paired, you can use SIRI or accept calls from steering controls. You can change the songs or skip FMs from steering controls. The volume control is also provided below steering. Handbrake is electronic, which requires minimal effort.Sound system with 6 speaker and all weather subwoofer in middle of dashboard is pure bliss. Side-view mirror vissibility can be electonically adjusted. Wipers are efficient.
Space & Comfort:
Having not used an SUV before and comparing Toyota's etios, which is several segments below Jeep, I can confidently say that a sedan is a sedan and no SUV can match the comfort it offers. But again, one should not compare apples to oranges.  The biggest disappontment was that Jeep could not make it a comfortable 5 seater at the least. Rear middle passenger is really cramped (This with every passenger falling below 60 KG) and not suitable for long drives. The rear vissibility is also poor from rear view mirror when 3rd passenger occupies the seat. Boot Space is OKyish - If the boot fills up, rear view mirror vissibility is again impacted.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine Performance:
This is where Jeep blew me away, FCA's 2.0 diesel engine is too good to be true. I had driven my etios for 40 K kms in 7 years. I have almost completed 10 K in my compass in under 3 months. It is a driver's dream. Driving comfort is unparallaled. 
Fuel Economy:
I followed the instructions from showroom of not exceeding 130 KM/H speed before 2000 KMs and got a mileage of close to 20 km/l in my first long trip to Munnar from Bangalore via Salem. There was minimal gear shifting required and I drove at constant 100 km/h speed. But it significantly drops with constant gear shifts and raising the vehicle suddenly.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is good, when it is used as a four seater. As per my family, it does not match the comfort of our etios. Handling is amazing.
Final Words This one is a head turner. Like old Onida Ad, world's envy, owner's pride. If only FCA could do something to increase the comfort of rear passengers, it would be really hard to beat Jeep in the segment.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales person.
I first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn't have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer.
I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer.
I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint. ""I cant say prices will increase etc..."" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off.

This car's turbo sets in around 2500 rpm. Till it reaches this rpm the car hardly moves, then suddenly it flies off the handle. This is impossible to control under most circumstances. In my opinion it is an accident waiting to happen. When i bring this up with the service station they just shrug it off as normal in all Jeep cars.

It has pathetic fuel efficiency. Be that as it may the engine capacity is so small that the car needs refueling constantly. I cannot go from Bangalore to Mysore and back without refueling.

I discovered this pretty early after buying the car. I decided to sell if even before i reached 1000 kms and one month after i purchased the car. When i inquired the purchase price, i was not even getting a quote for 17 lakhs. I paid 24.66 lakhs for the car.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I am jeep owner from almost 2 years and after driving it more than 40k km I am writing this review. I don't advise people to buy it. Following are the pros and cons

Pros.....  1) Its built quality and exterior is good.
2)  You get good grip and control on high speed on highways. 

Cons...... 1) Jeep compass probably the worst SUV in its segment which has extremely poor and if I have to be blunt then pathetic turning radius and you literally have to take reverse on each U-turn in the city and if you are driving it cities like Mumbai, Bangalore then you are done.
2) even after taking care of the vehicle and getting  it serviced on time the car started making noise. It's arm rest makes noise even the cover around steering wheel also not fitted well which also makes noise.
3) someone broke my wind shield which I got it replaced with new one but the size of new wind shield is little small and has not been fixed well it is making sound from the moment I got it fixed.
4) Most important point its engine stopped 3 times once on Express Highway and did not start then you have to wait for 20 minutes to get it started again which is terrible for a SUV where you have paid 20L. Even my 12 years old Honda City Engine never had this issue.
5) fabric seat covers after paying 20L is something you don't expect.

In my opinion you should go for other SUVs instead of putting 20L in this or wait for another year to get better options as it has all basic features which you can get in any 10-12L car except electronic hand break.

I bought this car thinking that its American brand and its going to be good product and after sales service but they have failed in both. They are selling inferior quality or they couldn't import quality which they sell in US or they are purposely selling poor quality products thinking that it's India and they can twist rules and regulations the way they want.",,2,,22-Jul-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p2/

It is a petrol variant with an engine capacity is 1.4, not worth to drive this car if you get an average of 5.4/km.",,1,,22-Sep-18,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p2/
Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Exterior I don't really like huge SUV's (like the Fortuner or Endeavour) and in my opinion the Compass is just perfect. Its not too small and not too big. The design compliments the size very well giving it a superb road presence. I love the side profile and that chrome strip that differentiates the rood and the rest of the body. I love the rear which is complimented with a nicely done LED tail lights. (even non-led's looks good).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Top notch interiors made from great quality materials. The leather seats, soft touch dash, soft touch top portion on the front doors and that superbly finished leather wrapped steering gave me a sense of luxury right away. The doors close with a nice sound and bloody hell its hefty. I got into the driver seat & pulled the centre arm rest froward and adjusted it to my driving position and boy it felt like a tank once I was done. There is a sense of security which I have never felt in any other car I've driven so far. Space is good in the front but spaces to put phones and other items lack a bit.
With the front seats in my driving position, I got into the rear and it was spacious enough. The seats are great but the middle portion lack underthigh support. The rear arm rest is super wide and it felt like the car is best for 4 adults. Overall 4 adults and a kid is ideal or 3 medium sized adults.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I'm a true petrol head and the diesels I've driven so far (S-cross 1.3 and Polo) had failed to impress me with the turbo lag and I expected the same since the compass has a bigger engine and bigger turbo, but boy the engine and the power delivery blew me away. The engine is smooth and there is no jerk whatsoever when the turbo kicks in. With 5 well weighed adults in the car, it pulled from 1400rpm in 3rd gear with ease. It was so linear and clean that it almost felt like I was driving a powerfull petrol mill. The gear shifts are notchy which is well complimented by a nicely weighed clutch. The steering has a lot of feedback and weight and it instantly gave me a smile.
Ride Quality & Handling Handlig was great, I didn't feel like driving a 1.5 ton machine but there is a sense of heft and I think its mainly because of the well weighed chunky steering and the tank feel the Compass has.
I cannot comment much on ride quality since I drove on a good surface but on that it as good and the car changed directions with confidence and ease.
Final Words I'm in love with this car and there is no other way to put. If I was in the market to get a car around 15lakhs, I would happily put 5lakhs more and will get the Longitude (O) model since it has the most bang for the buck. We can spend 10k for Jeep's original leather wrapped steering (5k) and reverse camera (5k) to add to the Longi (O) and make it a limited model without LED tail lights and leather seats.
Areas of improvement
1. Should have had 6 airbags on limited 4x2 at least.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I usually drive at maximum speed of 80-100, I have got fuel economy as 16.5 to 18km/l in city conditions and on highway it was 20 to 22.5km/l.
Ride Quality & Handling Great one.
Final Words I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied.
Till now I have driven around 4800 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 to 18km/l and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 to 22.5km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour.
I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams.
As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good.
Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly.
I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call.
I am happy with my choice. If anyone wants to ask anything, feel free to write me.

As you already know that I have purchased it just before 6 Months and has drawn It for just about 20000 Kms with all regular paid services from your dealer. In any case your Jeep Compass Model in India is not conforming to the safety and performance standards of International Level which you try to claim in your much hipped marketing in television and other related medias. However, In that case I want full refund of my money or if you provide me enough assurance that this type of problem will not appear again in your vehicle than I shall be ready to have a new car from your company as a replacement to my existing car. I hope that Jeep India team will understand my situation as I am paying my hard earned money behind your faulty and damaged Jeep Compass car, I shall not be ready to collect back this faulty model from your dealership after repairs and would like to request the competent authority to provide prompt justification in my case on urgent basis. Due to your faulty model Jeep Compass my business plans are totally disturbed and I have already faced a moral and indirect lost of more than 1.5 Lakh Indian rupees during last week. In short, I am providing you the only two options to choose from before I personally litigate you in the court of Law: 1) Refund my Full Money of Jeep Compass and take back your Faulty Vehicle. 2) Replace this Faulty Vehicle with the New Vehicle and Provide me an Assurance in Writing that If the same problem is found (with in12 Months again) in the new piece of vehicle you shall be liable to refund my full money in Cash. I am writing this letter as a formal complain to justify my stand and provide time of 5 Days to your company authority before I initiate a legal procedures against your company and the dealer from where I have been made fool to purchase this faulty and damaged vehicle. Look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Exterior The outlook of the car is quite masculine, I love the fact that the design cues have been insprired from the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
The height of the car is also good, its pretty neat car for our Indian roads, which during monsoon become off-roads 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interior of the car is charismatic. Nice tone of black and white.... But I would have preferred an all round black interiors with a hint of red trimmings. That would have made it look more sexy.
The white colour is hard to maintain.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The car packs amazing punch in the engine. I've not driven the car yet but just sat in it when it was at display in our city. I have opted for the Diesel Automatic version which is expected to launch in the first week of Jan 2018
Ride Quality & Handling Again, Ive not driven the car so I cannot comment on this part. But I'm sure, after watching many reviews on youtube, this car is a drivers car!
Final Words I just hope and wish they dont price the Diesel Auto variant too steep, otherwise it will loose the charm, becasue if it crosses the 25 Lac barrier, then we have more alternatives to look at. Maybe they should launch the Trailhawk version in that price range
Areas of improvement The rear styling is something i did not lilke. Also, if you look at the car from sideways, you will notice that the rear wheels are not fitting perfectly in the rear wheel arch! That came as a surprise to me.
Jeep should give Mopar  accessories in India.The front looks charming, the interiors are pretty good too!The rear tail light is not of my taste, the rear wheels do not fit properly in the wheel arch,",,4,,27-Aug-17,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p3/

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Don’t buy it from Jayaraj Motors (Tiruchirappalli)!! I purchased a ‘Jeep Compass Limited’ vehicle on March 2018 in the name of my company ‘*Rubine Glass Pvt Ltd*’ at Jayaraj Motors, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu. While purchasing I was told by the sales rep Mr. Jambukeshwar and Sales Manager (I think so) Muthu that there is no discount available for Jeep Compass even if 2 or 3 nos of vehicles bought together. This had been their repeated answer when I insisted for discount.
After purchasing the vehicle, my company was followed up many times by their (Jayaraj Motors) staff Mr. Jambukeshwar in the month of April to purchase second vehicle of same model with a discount of ?80,000/-.
When it was brought to my notice, I contacted Mr. Jambukeshwar and expressed my discontent for the false & unethical statement given to me during the time of first vehicle’s purchase and insisted to offer the discount of? 40000 for the first vehicle. After a long discussion, Mr. Jambukeshwar agreed that ?25000 of discount for my vehicle even in the case of second vehicle not purchased. When I contacted him for the cheque for the discounted amount and overpaid amount for Engine Insurance, he said only? 15000 as discount along with the overpaid amount can be given stating that as per MD’s instruction.
Since I was not in an mood to make it a scene, I asked him to pay the amount immediately. Again after few days, when I contacted him he said he was relieved from the company and Ms. Uma and Mr. Muthu will handle the issue of returning the amount. When I contacted Ms. Uma, she accepted that jambu had instructed to pay the amount and she was waiting for company’s MD’s signature on the cheque.
This was going on for around 3 weeks stating that ‘MD is not in the city.’ After she asked me to contact Mr. Muthu stating he will handle on this regard. When I explained Mr.Muthu over phone, he said he would speak to MD and get the amount. Irrespective of my repeated reminders to him in a space of every two days, he kept on saying the different excuses for almost a month. Thereafter, he started avoiding my phone calls.
(Only auto messages are received that he would contact shortly). Then, I wrote to their MD Mr. Ajay on 12th July about all what happened in the perception that he wouldn’t have known their Staff’s irresponsible and false commitments. He immediately responded that action will be taken. But till date, no action was taken. It’s really hurting and I feel insulted & cheated as a customer. And because of this, I couldn’t even enjoy the feel and ride of my new vehicle.
But, I don’t have any complaints about the vehicle. As of now, It is to my expectation. But, don’t buy it from an irresponsible and unethical dealer like Jayaraj Motors. Or negotiate with them like in a vegetable market (but nowadays, their prices are trustworthy) and get it in writing. More you bargain, more discount you may get (apart from company offers). These guys will surely spoil the reputation of the brand ‘JEEP’ in India..

Battery just after 14 months has drained out and they simply responded car is under 3 years warranty, not battery, not sure what more will not be under warranty, only time will tell

Service is average as usual committed to delivery at 4 and finally waited at the service center for 2 more hours

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I bought the jeep compass limited 4×4 in july under there upgrade plan for 4×4. So i purchased the car at a price of 23 lac instead of 25 lac on road. 
One thing i would i to say is that this is the beast when it comes to pure driving experience. No suv under 35 lac can beat it in terms of performance. I have one problem regarding some features  but many of them has already been included in the limited plus trim at a cost of 2 lac more, so no issue of that also.
My only suggestion to Jeep india is to price the longitude option model at 21 lac on road because of the newely arrived harrier. And please launch a diesel automatic in limited trim. If they do this than definitely there sales will reach around 1800 units a month.

My suggestion to customer is if you are planning for a SUV and your budget is over 21-22 lac than definitely go for compass. But if your budget is tight around 18-19 lac than go for harrier XZ over creta and other. 
Remember one thing only the XZ model of harrier is good to purchase because the rest of models lacks safety features which are on my priority number 1.",,5,,25-Jan-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p8/

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I had to write this review. It’s been about 5 months since I am driving Jeep Compass and mileage on odo just crossed 12,000 km. Bought it on 21 Feb 2019. Car was available quickly as they were clearing off 2018 stock and I got approx 90k benefits. Buying experience was awesome, smooth and spotless. I requested my chosen day delivery which Landmark Gurgaon guys were able to accommodate. First look of car and must say I fell in love with this machine. Car was delivered around 7 pm on 21st Feb which was a bit late. Didn’t know if any pre-delivery checks needed to be carried out by dealership guys at that point of time. But just got the car keys handed over in a ceremonial style with dealership guys clapping and taking pictures of key handing over.
First 500 KM: Spotless except one incident. Just before 500km on odo, car suddenly stopped and would not start. “Service Engine” message was popping up on instrument panel. I had to wait for about half an hour before trying to start the engine. Engine started but it  was enough for me to get worried. Called up my dealership contact and told him about the incident. Next day he sent someone from dealership and the “engine service” message was taken care of presumably by hard resetting car’s info message panel. My dealership contact told they had topped up engine oil and done pre-delivery checks which were not done at the time of delivery. I was surprised how could they miss that! But didn’t know myself about this check at the time of delivery.
First 5000 km: Got my first free servicing done at 5000 km.Experience was quite nice. Service center in Sector 34 Gurgaon had AC waiting hall and offered coffee and water. It took around 5 hours in servicing. They did wheel alignment and balancing apart from topping up all oils. Interior and exterior of car got cleaned. I had two long trips by this time: first of about 1300 km to and fro Delhi-Haridwar-Mussoorie-Delhi with a bit of detour and second of about 2000 km to and fro Delhi-Lucknow-Gorakhpur-Muzzafarpur-Delhi. Overall driving experience was awesome. It was March and weather was still a bit cold. Took Yamuna Expressway and newly built Agra-Lucknow Expressway. Fuel economy was roughly around 13.5 km/litre for both trips. Must say road grip and stability of Compass is way too superior. Cruising at around 120-160 mark was effortless and never realized till the time I saw odometer. Happy happy except one incident where I got a big dent on driver’s side rear door while backing up and didn’t got idea of side wall and got rubbed against it - thinking it would have been better should Jeep have provided 360 degree view camera which we see in one segment lower Kicks and recently launched Hector. However, came back Delhi and got it claimed through 0 dep insurance. Total bill was Rs. 7500 and I had to pay Rs. 2000 as deductible.
The D-Day: This is when I became really disappointed with Jeep Compass, Jeep India team and Landmark dealership. I was again on a long road trip of around 2000 KM stretch back to my hometown Gopalganj and was traveling across Yamuna Expressway. It was 1:30 pm on a hot sunny day on 25-May-2019 with temperature ranging about 45 degrees and my odo mileage around 8800 KM. I was traveling along with my pregnant wife, mom and my puppy Blaze at a speed between 90-100 km/hour. Just before Mathura toll plaza of Yamuna Expressway, my passenger side rear Tyre got burst into pieces. I could 
smell something burning in my cabin and was about to apply brakes when I felt a sudden jolt but still could not figure out what went wrong. I didn’t lose control of my steering wheel, didn’t apply brakes, took off my leg from accelerator and just let wheels roll over. When speed was less than 60 km/hour I applied brakes slightly and then immediately released. By this time, I knew some Tyre got burst as car was wobbling. I put on my left side indicators and started moving toward side curb. After about 0.7 KM from the location where Tyre got burst, I was able to pull over the curb. Luckily, cars traveling behind me, saw this entire episode happening right in front and slowed down. I was in complete shock, out of mind and didn’t know how to react for a brief time once I stopped. Three cars stopped to know our well-being and helped me over with Tyre change. One of the guy from those cars also brought back the burst piece of Tyre lying more than half km behind and I could see few burn marks in his hand because of the heat from burst Tyre.  I averted a major personal catastrophe which could well have life long implications on my remaining family if we were not able to survive on so called Road to Hell cemented Yamuna Expressway. Bursting of Tyre was totally unexpected given I had checked air pressure just before starting the trip and it was just 3 months 4 days old car having 8800 km on odo. I was so infuriated and agitated that I immediately called up Jeep India customer care and Landmark service center to report this incident. 
Resolution Provided for Burst Tyre from Jeep India and Landmark dealership: Tyre is not covered directly by Jeep and coverage comes from Tyre manufacturer which in this case is Bridgestone. Firestone Tyres manufactured by Bridgestone is used in Jeep Compass up to Limited Plus editions. After inspection of the burst Tyre, Bridgestone told that burst happened due to side wall damage of Tyre because of low/flat pressure and not because of any manufacturing defect and rejected the claim. Jeep India replaced the burst Tyre free of cost as a goodwill gesture. I knew my Tyres were in good condition, almost new and also had checked the air pressure before starting the trip, so there was no way air pressure would come down. I told them that Tyre was not able to handle the heat generated by cemented Yamuna Expressway on a hot sunny noon and as a result oxygen inside the Tyre would have expanded to a limit which the Tyre was not able to handle and got burst. I googled about Jeep Compass Tyre burst and could spot few reviews where people have faced similar Tyre bursts in a hot day because of the substandard quality of Firestone Tyres used in Jeep Compass. I spent around 24 lakhs to buy this vehicle just to know that Tyres are not covered by Jeep warranty and Tyre manufacturer Bridgestone would not accept claim giving rubbish reasons of low/flat Tyre pressure. Jeep should have provided this vehicle without Tyres and would have asked customers to choose Tyres of their choicest manufacturer since warranty is covered by manufacturer. I asked Jeep India team to provide Firestone Tyre compatibility and safety check report for Jeep Compass on Indian road conditions which they must have done before launching Jeep Compass but they failed to provide. I went through online Consumer Affair portal and lodged a complaint against Jeep Compass for this incident and to ask them to replace my all four Tyres with a much reliable Tyre brand like Michelin or Goodyear but none outcome to my favor!",,2,,16-Jul-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p11/

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Lets make it short and simple.
1. Jeep doesn't have alot of dealers and most cities have just one. These people kind of hold a monopoly position so getting better deals is next to non. These dealers usually have a very obsolete method of ordering cars which ends up extending the delivery date from the date of booking for over a month in most cases.

2. Compass feels sturdy and rides over most bumps with super ease. The car is still a little bit on the stiffer side so some bumps can get to you in a little more aggressive manner but that leads to a better handling car which for it's size is pretty darn great. 

There is the typical turbo lag under 1.8k RPM but not very zombie-ish types. There is a good punch of power right after the mark but tbh, it doesn't feel like a 170ish bhp car. Maybe thats the output at crank and not at wheels.

The cabin might be a little small for people who expect to carry a soccer team in a 23L car but for 4 adults, space is more than enough. Top of all that, it gets a panoramic sunroof which is lovely, especially during the summers where it'll get you skin tanned to a 4th degree burn!! Well jokes aside, it does make the cabin a lot more appealing and even the car as a whole feels more worth the price with the addition of a few new features in the limited plus option but strangely misses out on cruise control(i dont see much use of it but most people i spoke to about he car hate this miss)

The looks of the car comes down to your perspective. I truly believe this car looks amazing especially in the dark grey shade with the black glossy roof.

The only point of uncertainty is the reliability issues coming up with this car. 
A few common issues are-
A) premature clutch burn
B) brakes failure
C) electronics failure (music system, startstop)
D) poor quality control (exposed parts in the interior and water leaking into taillight)

But I'd still go for the car for the premium feeling interior or i might not got for it thanks to white colour leather seats and arm rest which will get soiled in less than an hour in Indian climate conditions

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is quite nice.Front leg room is good and we can view the road easilyI personally didnt like the white colours as they can get bad.didnt like the dummy buttons in steering. Also it would have been nice if there was a lock for changing between drive modes (mud, sand) because i have been told that if you do that while drriving the engine might get bad.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Awesome pull in the high ranges.Fuel ecnomy is very good. While driving with AC on you get 14 kmph else you get 17kmph. The best part is gearbox although the clutch is a little low shifting is so easy.
Ride Quality & Handling It is as if I am riding a car having good ground clerance. Handling is swift.It has lesser turning radius.
Final Words Jeep better than all among competitors.Stylish comfortable you name it. I think I am going to see them a lot in the roads.Hope the service network also does with the expectations.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I bought my car from Jeep store @omr RDC royale on Januar 4th 2018. The buying experience was good barring a couple of days delay. They even arranged for the pujas to be done prior to taking delivery of the car. I was very thrilled to take it on the highways, but had to wait 3 months for that to happen. And finally when the day came it was all the more exciting. The sheer torque and the power of the car made it feel like flying on the highways. The steering was always in control even at 170 kmph. The car felt well grounded at high speed overtakes and on the straight line too. One thing i was really disappointed with was the mileage which i got only 12.5 kmpl even on the highways. My hometown doesn't have good roads as we see in the metros, but my Jeep was able to tackle all the bad patches. With ease, which is a testimony to the ride quality of the car. Although everything was going good, when i was returning home from a long drive i noticed that the ESP warning had started glowing. That is the only problem i have faced with the vehicle till now.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Buying experience of Jeep compass sport model is too good because it is the base model of Jeep compass starting from 15 laks onwards. Riding experience of this model is a top notch in both city and highway but on highway is a great cruiser. The body roll of Jeep compass is outstanding around the corners and stability is also outstanding on the highways and which is the best in the segment. This is the only petrol SUV comes with maximum power around 161bhp and highest than its rivals.  Looks of Jeep Compass is the best in its segment with seven slat grille with commanding design, looking dynamic and looks sportier. Performance is outstanding with 1.4 litre petrol engine because it drives smoothly, punchier and nicer to drive. Jeep compass petrol mileage around 15 to 16 kmpl on the highways if you drive not too much fast and in city 10 to 12 kmpl. Servicing and maintainence of compass is reasonable and not much expensive in petrol variants while in diesel it is too expensive to maintain the vehicle and while servicing cost is expensive.  

PROS:
1. It comes with safety features such as EPB, ESP, Hill Start Assist, Roll Over Mitigation, All Disc Brakes, Traction Control and Hill Descent Control as standard. 
2.) 6 speed manual gearbox is joy and easy to use. 
3.) Class leading off road capabilities. 
4.) Build quality and interior quality is a top notch and best in the segment. 
5.) Plastic quality and materials are used on the compass are extremely superb and best in its class. 
6.) The individual suspension set up of the compass  which further increases its off-road capabilities. 

CONS:

1. Missing some features like cruise control, electric ORVM turn indicators, alloy wheels and other features etc. 
2. Poor rear seat comfort and feels cramped for three adults. 
3. The petrol engine is noisy than the other rivals like creta and hector. 
4. Too pricey 
5. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking. 
6. 7 speed DCT automatic transmission is not very smooth, quickest, lacks punch and feels jerkiness on the highways.",,5,,30-Jul-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p18/

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I have always been a fan of the Compass since it was launched back in 2017. Being a student and a big car enthusiast, it was really hard to convince my parents to choose this car over the Creta (There was a 5 lakh rupees price difference!). 

Recently, my best friend got the newly launched Sport Plus 1.4 Petrol variant of the Compass(Harrier effect, maybe?). And I must say, I wish my family had waited for this. 

He surprisingly agreed to take the Compass for a road trip to Rishikesh which we've been planning for days and I got to drive this beauty for quite a while to write this review. 
Under the hood, this two-wheel-drive car packs the same Fiat-sourced 1.4 litre turbo petrol engine producing 160 bhp of power and 250 Nm of torque which we've already seen in the top spec variants.

The car is loaded! We get 16 inch Alloy wheels, roof rails, dual zone automatic climate control, a 5 inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers and all the standard safety features along with the signature electronic parking brake. One more thing, there's a hidden easter egg near the bonnet of the car and it's just better that you notice it yourself. 

Some people might find the infotainment unit smaller compared to the 7 inch one seen in higher variants, but not us! It doesn't have a stock rear parking camera, but you can install that as an accessory. The speakers work really well. Also, conventional headlamps are provided with this variant and there's no sunroof on offer. 

Now let's talk about driving this beauty. 
This car, is a beast! The turbo kicks in after 2300 rpm and you get that kick in the pants feeling. This car crushed all the bad roads which we encountered in the hills. Although the suspension is a bit on the stiffer side, body roll is negligible and the Compass feels so much alive when you're cruising through those corners and the brakes work very well. 

Arguably this variant, the Sports Plus, will give you the most bang for your buck. It packs all the necessary features, and even more! 
This is a proper driver's car with much practicality on offer. Priced at 15.60 lakhs ex-showroom, I would definitely recommend this Compass to all the interested buyers in this segment. 

Definitely a 5 star rating from my side!",,5,,14-Jun-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/jeep-cars/compass/userreviews-p18/

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"I bought a Jeep Compass Longitude optional a year back in Sep 2017 and was enjoying my rides like any other users, the overall performance of the vehicle is as good as expected, BUT when I went for the service my overall experience is turned down. I met with a minor accident and went for servicing the car at TURBO auto in Vijayawada, Andhrapradesh as I have only one choice in this city and they informed me that radiator and inter cooling system needs to be replaced along with the front bumper. It took 11 days for them to complete the work as I understood that the time would take for them in general is not more than 2 or 3 days. the reason as I understood is the spare parts was not being maintained by the service centres and I wonder the first thing that will get damage is the bumper and radiator when a car meets with the accident.

Though I got the comprehensive insurance, when went to take the vehicle for delivery I was asked to pay 8600 Rs additional amount as they installed a bumper with chrome which they claim is not covered by the insurer (Bharathi Axa). which after enquiry with the service advisor understood that the part which the service centre guys ordered somehow changed ( I wonder how this could happen for a service oriented industry's these days) and when I denied to pay for what I have not asked neither chose the service centre guys denied to deliver the vehicle and asked for one more day to remove the chrome from the bumper to and deliver the vehicle and I have to leave the vehicle again at service centre to fix the right one.

Carwale.com,Jeep Compass,"Buying Experience: I had a decent buying experience from Landmark Gurgaon. Although, they changed the delivery timelines twice but the Sales Manager was responsive, mostly.
Riding Experience: Majorly, its been very good riding experience. On the Highways, its one of the best monocoque SUVs on the Indian roads. In city conditions, the ride can get a bit bumpy due to stiff suspension, however, there's a very reassuring feeling to be in this cabin.
Looks & Performance: Looks for this butch SUV is the trump card. It looks premium and sure is a head-turner with those 18 inch alloys. For the performance, I'd rate this as a decent 4/5. Although, there's a bit of a lag initially (due to the turbo), however, if you get the hang of throttle response you can actually make the pick-up very linear. It has a very strong mid range and pulls very nicely for the weight of this car and never feels under powered. 
Service & Maintenance: I've got my car services once and the experience was fine. However, i believe there's an issue with the Battery from most buyers i have spoken to.
Pros: Great looks, Safety features and robust cabin, convenient to drive with Automatic, fit & finish of the cabin

HiTech features makes you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Over all I am very happy. 

Details about look: I liked the external design of the car. For me it appears like a mini Toyota Fortuner from some angles. 

Performance: 
After driving it in different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""under powered"" . I am not an auto expert to give figures on RPM vs Torque etc. Even the fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl).

Carwale.com,MG Hector,"I booked MG hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for Smart DCT, (Aurora Silver) at MG’s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept Motors.

I had driven MG hector before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. I was with the same Sales person from whom I booked the car. I was just cruising around on the service road, when there was a sudden thud in the engine. The car stopped immediately after that. I had to put it in 2nd Manual so that car started moving again. There was no response from the car in any other gears. I tried to manually adjust in 1-3-4-R none of them worked. In any of the gears other than 2nd I would see an orange coloured exclamation mark on the information cluster. The sales person told that there was some issue in the transmission. He called some guy from the tech team and found out the transmission had failed. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. 

I cancelled the booking very next day to which their manager told me to wait for a few days until we find what the issue was in regards to. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. While booking they had promised to refund in 15 days though it took them 28 days to process it through and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. 

The car is good on cosmetics, but I don’t think so that you can rely on the engine in the long run. MG still needs to refine the Engine according to the Indian roads. Giving variety of features won’t help if there is an issue with the Engine Quality.",,1,,9-Sep-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/mg-cars/hector/userreviews-p2/
Carwale.com,MG Hector,"It's a beautiful suv design wise, no doubt about it. However the steering control is poor. The screen doesn't respond properly to the commands. Tyres look very small. Interior finish is ok type. Driver seats are adjustable but not comfortable. Worst part is the curtain of sunroof, which looks like a mosquito net, very thin. Front and back parts are made up of cheap plastic. A true Chinese product, you will be lured by beauty but actual performance is poor.

I still consider harrier or compass is better that how they looks 
This car is filled with a lot of features 
But sometimes these features will annoy you 
Like ""hello MG ""
These are all gimmicky things to attract more and more audience..
Infact the seating of harrier is way better than the Hector 
Underthigh support is missing 
And the elements are copy from other manufacturers too!
Like the rear is fully copied from Audi 
The infortainment system copied from Volvo
Instrument cluster copied from Aston Martin

Also even the base model is equipped with hill descent , hill hold, ESP,cooled glove box,TC,rear defogger and wiper which is a great security feature on hill drives,keyless entry etc .. it also comes with the factory fitted music system which is not in tata harrier.

Carwale.com,MG Hector,"*Have not bought the car*
2. Riding Experience: To understand Hector properly, you'll have to drive it first. It is a big car and by big I mean bigger than XUV 500(In terms of length) and it's a heavy car. For a brief moment you'll forget about it's weight because of the incredibly light steering wheel but on corners and harder braking scenarios, It's quite evident. The front seats offer adequate under thigh and lower back support but would have loved it better if it had an option to control the lumbar support. The seats keep you in place during turns and is cushioned just right to offer better comfort over prolong periods of driving (Driven 300+kms in a stretch) Rear seats have more than enough headroom and legroom but you might end up wanting a little more under thigh support. I think that is compensated by the option of reclining rear seats which is a really good feature in my opinion. The Sunroof is massive and lets in a lot of light. Only the front portion opens up but is big enough. (Would highly recommend people from not sticking their body out). The suspension is soft and by soft I mean it's really good on uneven surfaces but when driving at highway speeds, it can get a little over wobbly oven sudden undulation. This is why I feel, it's a better car for in city long distance drives. Visibility all around is great except the rear where I find the rear glass a little too small but that is where you can use 360 degree cameras (Really helpful in tight parking spots) though the quality of the camera is not even close to being the level needed in a 20L+ car. The screen is BIG and has tons of features (Watch online videos for indepth) In short, it's good but laggy and annoying at times. In built TOM TOM maps is bad and not updated. Thank god the car has Apple Play and Android Auto, GOOGLE MAPS to the rescue. 
I think the best way to describe the cabin of Hector is that it's looks premium, first impression will be of a really high end expensive car but after sometime, the quality feels lacking and straight off cheap. No rattling sounds over my test runs but a few owners reported rattles from the sunroof. 
3.  Details about Looks, Performance, etc.: Looks being a subjective matter, i'll leave it for you to decide but I can give my two points about it:
a) The car does not look well proportioned. (From back, looks too narrow, from sides, looks like an MPV due to smaller wheels and weird shaped quarter windows, looks the best from front.)
b) The rims are perfectly sized but the tyres is what needs help. Narrow tyres and small side walls look bad with the body bulk on top. It desperately needs thicker and wider tyres. Current ones squeak over every sharpish turn. Not adequate. 
The 2.0 litre Fait engine is probably the best part about the car. It's punchy and decently refined. Won't leave you wanting more. 
I was able to get roughly 16 kmpl on highways and 12 ish within the city. 
Brakes are really good and give a very confidence building feel.

Servicing and maintenance: Only time will tell about these factors but MG's 5 year warranty does give a sense of relief to a rather new and unknown brand.

Pros:
a) Bang for the buck.  Feature loaded to the brim.
b) Wonderful cruiser.
c) Spacious for passengers as well as cargo.
d) Very easy to drive. Does not feel big due to the light steering wheel.
e) excellent engine. Really good drivability and decent fuel economy. 
f) Soft suspension offers really comfortable ride in city speeds but definitely not meant to be driven enthusiastically.

Cons:
a) Misses out on some really obvious features. Auto dimming IRVM, Ventilated seats, etc.
b) Laggy screen (really disappointed)
c) Overall plushness
d) 'SAD' tyres. Needs an upgrade.
e) Unknown after sales and service.",,4,,14-Oct-19,,,,https://www.carwale.com/mg-cars/hector/userreviews-p20/

Carwale.com,MG Hector,"Before writing these review I'm a car enthusiast  have driven multiple car around the world and I always try to give an honest review,
Now coming to the MG hector well do not think this is the same company which once had these fancy convertible and u just have the name, this car is a Chinese car owned by SAIC motors.

Now one these car
Pros:
1) looks although is vary person t person still it is good
2) Space is best in class (comparing harrier,compass,seltos,Xuv 500)
Cons:
1) lack of power specially a 2 liter engine car it is shockingly under power with claim 169 bhp where as compass with 171 bhp seems way more powerful and it is surprising even car like ecosport/creta feels way more fun to drive.
2) Ghostly gear change even if you change the gear there is no change rpm for sometimes there is a sound from gearbox I have tested 2 hector and the same thing and these executive from showroom has no idea and they are very arrogent and saying this car has highest booking in india really funny business strategy.
3) Suspension : now that is a scary part, in some large bumps it feels like the parts are moving out similar bumps compass and xuv are running like anything , these is a cluntchy sound in any bump and the executives are saying it is happening is test drive car I really font think any suv with 3000 km should not make such thing.
4) The panoramic sunroof : it is taking long to open and close and especially once open making sound from he top, no way is is even close to compass sunroof.
5) The voice command does not work if there is mild sound outside.
60 The quality of the interior plastic seems cheap compared to the price range
7) The history of Chinese automobiles and their reliability (don't know what that will be in India and how that will go in the future)


Final verdict :  If you are spending this much increase 1 lakh more and go with Jeep compass limited plus or Mahindra Xuv500 W11(O), I have not tested seltos so can not comment on that
else go for ecosport or creta you will spend less and these are value for money.

First mileage update. Completed first tank to tank, recorded mileage of 9.0+. This is 100% BLR traffic mileage, including 50% in the grinding ORR traffic (i.e. crawling). The MID showed 9.4 in this round so pretty close

Did an morning airport run of 80kms and overall mileage for that trip was 14.3 on MID so again pretty decent. Overall, not as bad as I had feared.

The pickup is addictive; one push to the pedal and it goes like a rocket, pretty handy on the empty stretches of ORR.

0 issues with temperature (BLR is cold right now) .

I'm not regretting my decision to move away from diesel mills!

Apart from that, yet to figure out some features in the car (e.g. perfume settings).

Hope to go on an inter-city drive soon!",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"My intention of this post is to ensure, I try to answer the below questions for prospective buyers & existing customers:

* My Requirement?
* Shortlisted Car?
* Why Kia?
* Which Dealer in Hyderabad?
* Which model?
* Pre-delivery Instructions
* Delivery Instructions
* Post Delivery - What treatment is recommended after buying your car and from where (incl costing estimates)?

After precisely 8 years 11 months and 13 days of using my existing car (Hyundai i10) clocking 1,42,000kms, I finally could afford to upgrade. Since the last 2 years, I have only been contemplating of buying a new car. Being a car and speed enthusiast, my requirement of a new car had been clear, it has always been:

My Requirement?
1. Power (the more the bhp the better | 0-100kmph <10 sec | min 120+ bhp)
2. Fits my budget, I could max stretch around 23lakhs.
3. Only top-end to be considered; need all the bells and whistles - don’t like local mechanics fiddling with electronics.
4. 160mm+ ground clearance, only reason being pothole filled roads, water flooding in rainy season and long drives in uneven unforeseen roads.
5. Sophisticated looks.

Shortlisted Cars?

I already had test-driven and shortlisted few cars, here’s the list and why I didn’t buy any of them:

• Jeep Compass (Diesel Manual): One of my favorites; ticks mostly all requirements and has excellent built quality and engine. I had in-fact taken this on-lease and used it extensively for a couple of days. Rejected due to; negative feedback about after sales, low dealership network, Jeep brand known for niggles, for the price being paid very less features, not value for money.

• Skoda Octavia (1.8 TSI): After an actual test-drive, I was sold out on this car. The 180 bhp engine is a monster in disguise. Such effective auto-gearbox and the car felt planted even at 120+ speed. Rejected due to; low ground clearance (on my test-drive itself the car was scrapping at pot-hole), no discounts at all on the Onyx model in-spite of being BSIV engine, dealer monopoly in Hyderabad (only 1 dealer with all showrooms), top end L&K dead expensive and a new model is just around the corner with BSVI engine and better design.

• Hyundai Verna (Diesel Manual): In-spite of being a sedan, its ground clearance is excellent (165mm). Its fast and looks & feels premium. Rejected due to; New model to be launched very soon, new features missing “Internet Inside”, etc. Yet I would have bought it if Kia would not have launched at all.

Why Kia?
It has been a love-hate relationship with Kia ever since I read about media and customer complaints. Issues like select media issuing a statement on not reviewing Kia, Issues with Delivery Commitments, Spare availability issues, DCT Overheating issues, pre-sales issues with dealers, etc kept me thinking about committing to Kia. Yet, I choose to move ahead, giving a benefit of doubt to Kia, assuming they would resolve these as soon as they establish themselves in India with strong backing from Hyundai. And top of it, it ticked all the boxes in my requirements and has been a pure value for money offering with the turbo engine, features and dealership network in India.

Which Dealer?
There are 3 actual dealers with 5 showrooms across Hyderabad. I choose to go with Automotive Kia in Kondapur. While, there are others too, but the only reason I went with Automotive Kia in Kondapur; they had the car available immediately and my pre-sale exp with Car Kia was not impressive.

Automotive Kia | Kondapur (Hi-tech City)
Automotive Kia | Nagole
Car Kia | Jubliee Hills
Vihaan Auto | Kukatpally
Vihaan Auto | Secunderabad

Heads-up: I literally was about to cancel my booking at this dealership. The reason being, the way the whole booking process was being handled. Right from a sales executive who didn’t know even the basics like, providing a receipt for booking amount or calling back the customer if he is calling you time and again just to get one update. Somehow, they pacified me to continue my booking.

Which Model?
Honestly, I am not an automatic lover at all. I need the gears to work according to my taste rather than rely on their AI. Yet my perception was completely changed after driving the 1.8TSI Octavia. Its DCT (Wet) is super-slick and fast, but that comes with a cost. My driving varies with my mood and a DCT too can never match the pace. In an automatic, I need the effectiveness of a DCT and maintenance like Torque converter. Hence, I ended up with a 1.4 GTX Plus Manual. And trust me, the clutch is super smooth, while it does have a little more travel, but you’ll get used to it in no time. With a manual, I can be care-free with the gearbox and can leverage the optimum potential of the car.

Booking Instructions:
• Ensure you check with every dealer on discounts if any, while for Kia there are no discounts you can still negotiate on Insurance, Accessories costing.
• If you are taking the top-end model, do not buy the accessories – most of the basic accessories are already included in the car except mats.
• Full matting was provided by the dealer by charging extra ~Rs 4,500 [image below]. Ensure you confirm this while booking.
• Be very clear about the date of delivery and take it in writing and signed from the sales executive on the same booking receipt.
• Ensure the model number, the color of the car and fuel type is mentioned correctly on the booking form.
• Check on insurance benefits, right from engine protect to return to invoice option.

Pre-delivery Inspection:

While I blindly followed the team-bhp checklist I ensured the below points were emphasized on:
• The first thing to check while you have the car in front of you, Odometer reading. It should be ~<=100kms. And should be working, this will confirm that there was no tampering done.
• Next, a very important point to be checked: Car Manufacturing Month and Year. Ask the car person to show you the embedded VIN number on the chassis of the car (usually below the driver seat) – you can decode it online or check with the Kia representative.
• The next step is to check for any dents or scratches across the car which are evident.
• Check all tyre’s including the Stepney is of the same brand and looks new.
• Check if the car’s jack and its accessories are included.
• Check the IDV value in the Insurance quote, it should be just 5% less than the ex-showroom price.
• Check if all the documentation incl. Invoice has VIN/Engine number mentioned as-is, as embedded in the car.
• Check if FastTag and car manual are available (my dealer charged me for the FastTag but never gave me one).
• Check if 5liter Petrol/Diesel is available in the car from the dealer.
• Please ensure whichever phone number and email address you provide in your forms, the same phone number is used while configuring your UVO app. If not, it won’t get configured. Once configured, you can share full access, I mean you can replicate the same access to any phone number in your family/friends.
• Finally, if you do believe in an auspicious time of delivery, then ensure give a heads-up to the sales representative that he needs to keep the car ready at [x: xx am/pm] time, as you are very particular about taking your car delivery at a certain time.

Delivery Instructions:

And finally, when the moment arrives; before just driving away in excitement, just hold back and have a quick check on these points:
• Check if Service Manual is provided by the representative delivering your car.
• Check if there are any scratches or dents anywhere on the body of the car, re-verifying as in my case the delivery was taking a day after the pre-inspection. Hence just to be safe please re-check.
• Check if the FastTag sticker is provided, this is already charged in your invoice.
• Ensure both the keys are provided to you; this is very important considering, recently Insurance companies have confirmed that they can decline claims if they find out that the customer doesn’t possess both the keys and will negate the claim stating the theft happened due to negligence of the customer.
• Ensure you take the invoice copy and PUC certificates from the dealer.
• Please ensure the Kia representative helps you configure the UVO connect app on your phone and helps ensure its configured and working.
• Please ensure you remove the sticker which contains the VIN, Engine number and other private details from the car window(s).
• Your Kia Seltos manual will be provided in a leather-like case. Ensure you get yours too.

What treatment after buying?
After spending all my free time on car reviews and comparisons, I finally purchased the Kia Seltos GT and that’s when the next big dilemma was born – What kind of protective coating should I go for on my car? And once again, my research started; there are tons of options available in the market like Teflon coating, anti-rust coating, ceramic coating, paint protection films, anti-mice coating, sound insulation coating, windshield films, etc.

Now the big question was, which treatment(s) to go for and from which reliable dealer?

Below are the treatments I shortlisted based on my discussion with various car enthusiasts and dealers. And then I decided based on my requirements if they are really value-for-money.
• 3M Ceramic Coating
• 3M Trizact Treatment
• 3M Paint Protection Film (PPF a.k.a Clear Bra) | the only film officially licensed to protect NASCAR race cars.
• 3M Rodent Repellant Coating
• 3M Underbody Anti-Rust Coating
• 3M Glossy Black Wrap for Roof-top and Wing Mirrors (top-end GTX Plus model doesn’t come in dual tone)

After talking to literally all 3M and non-3M dealers in Hyderabad, I was well equipped with all the knowledge I needed about each treatment and its costing. My biggest confusion was with PPF vs Ceramic. Considering PPF for a White color car was risky, most dealers said they would not take the risk as the film might get yellowish tint after 2-3 years, which might not look good. While one of the 3M dealers confirmed, the current film manufactured by 3M can be installed on a white color car without any issues.

With all the consolidated information and talking to car detailing dealers across, I finally went ahead with the below package from 3M Madhapur:
• 3M Paint Protection Film (PPF)
• 3M Trizact Treatment
• 3M Rodent Repellant Coating
• 3M Underbody Anti-Rust Coating
• 3M Glossy Black Wrap for Roof-top and Wing Mirrors

The whole package cost me precisely Rs 1,10,000 and the time it took was 2.5 days. If you are going for a PPF treatment, it is highly recommended to get this done as soon as you take the delivery of the new car. In my case, I got it done in just 3-days of taking the delivery.

Tips & Tricks
Below are a few tips & tricks which I feel can be beneficial:
* You can turn off the annoying single-horn sound the car makes when you lock or unlock the car: Just press the lock and unlock key together for 10 sec, the car will blink twice and you can rejoice the peace mode.
* If your car is locked and you have the key in your pocket, just go near the wing mirror and see the magic; wing mirrors will open automatically for you.
* Download the below apps:
* Kia Link India (service and maintenance needs) Android iOS
* Kia UVO Lite (remote control your media) Android
* Kia UVO (connected car solution integrates car, smartphone & infotainment) Android iOS
* Kia Owner’s Manual Android
* Kia Online Service Manual Download
* Kia Seltos is based on the same chassis as its Korean version with 1.6 turbocharged 177 Bhp engine – which implies the existing chassis for 1.4 turbo petrol engine is built to handle ~240kmph.
* In-case if you feel like upgrading your tyre, then the best option is Michelin Primacy 4 ST 215/60 R17 96H (MRP: Rs 10,490)",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"After owning my pre-owned Civic for a little over seven years now, I have finally decided to take the plunge and buy a new car for myself. I have booked the Kia Seltos GTX+ D-AT in Aurora black and I'm expecting the delivery on Saturday this week, with the car having arrived at the dealers yard as of last saturday.

I have a couple of quick questions if I may.

I have read a lot of fellow BHPians suggest that for top-end version, skip the accessories package. I see the basic package (silver) includes things like mobile charger (which is redundant, especially considering there are two USB ports and a qi charger), idol, garbage bin etc. Can I expect the top variant to have at least have mud-flaps and or door sills for example?

As for my next question, I see the UVO app allows remote unlocking for example. Would I be able to leave my keys in the car and simply use my mobile to unlock the vehicle and start up (with or without the keys in the car) My SA was never able to give a clear answer for this.",,,,,,,

Mud Flaps are standard on GT line variants. You can get door sills from a good aftermarket firm if you like.",,,,,,,

We're you able to do the inspection prior to registration and if Yes, then did they allow you to check out the interiors?

In my case, I had visited the stockyard and I could do only inspection from outside. They did not allow me to open the car and check inside.
Don't know if this is the norm everywhere.

The vehicle is going for registration today and in couple of days I should be receiving her.",,,,,,,

Congrats on your milestone, Karan!

Sorry for cross-posting on the KIA thread. I have a similar observation as yours, about a random beep coming at speeds other than 80 & 120. After a lot of attempts, I observed there is no message on the MID when this random beep comes (unlike the ""Reduce Speed"" message at 80 & 120). Also, I haven't been able to find a reason or pattern for the beep - it comes at random speeds above 80 kmph and comes even when the Cruise Control is not set.

Anyone else observed this and knows the reason for it? I thought a lot about it, probable causes and finally gave up! Now it is just another music for me

KIA module device is not released yet by the company and the dealers say it might take few months before the device is released. The KIA Link app is not compatible with other OBD devices. So I would suggest to continue using the app without the module until it is available for purchase.

PS: If you face any challenge in logging in or registering on the app, then reach out to your dealer who can configure it quickly for you.",,,,,,,

As per the govt rules,

""The audible warning shall warn the driver with frequency not less than 1 cycle/ 2 minute when vehicle speed indicated in the speedometer exceeds 80 km/h (primary level) and continuously or intermittently with frequency not less than 1 cycle/ 2 sec when the vehicle speed indicated in the speedometer exceeds 120 km/h (secondary level).""

So they want the 80KMPH beep to repeat every 2 minutes at the very least. So it's not just beep once when crossing 80kmph - it's beep when crossing 80kmph and maintaining 80kmph+ for over 2 mins.

Don't know if this is the norm everywhere.

Yes, I did the complete inspection prior - they did and should allow pre-delivery inspection for the complete vehicle both inside out.

Thanks so much. Unfortunately the car is going to be delayed by a couple of days due to loan processing (realized too late, that we didn't have enough cheque leaves) Anyways it's scheduled to be picked up next Wednesday, and the time seems to move too slow

Go to the service center or wait till the first service. During the first service, they apply rubber plugs / foam to a few corners, on their own accord, to fix the rattle.

I don't know what Horizon is and couldn't find info on the net. What I'm willing to bet money on is that you can get the same or possibly better treatment and workmanship done from a reputable independent detailer. I did find info on Trizact online.

The pressed steel panels - doors, bonnet, fenders - are really tastefully designed & made. Sculpted well!
There are continuous curves, bulges & troughs along the panels and hardly any flat surface. It looks very good & pleasant. Nice effort put in there.
The lines & curves flow really well. Seamlessly across the panels & meet their ends perfectly blending into another panel.

Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Right from day 1 I felt the lighting setup on the HTK lacking, especially on the low beam. In the absence of DRLs and lacklustre halogens in the projectors I was looking for an upgrade. A few weeks ago, I got the Osram DHB3 HID conversion kit installed with 6000K lamps. Costed Rs.10,650.

It was purchased and installed at my dealer. Wiring had to be spliced and caps had to be drilled, but the manager assured they'll take care of warranty issues, if any arise - the only condition being that the car must be taken to them and not any other ASC. I like such dealers who encourage us to enjoy our cars in the way we want and also cover our backs.

I see a marked difference after the upgrade. The low beam is immensely better and the high beam is very bright. I'm aware of the problems with 6000K over 4200K lights. But for my car usage pattern that wouldn't be a big issue and I wanted white beams.

The only gripe I now have is the odd looking setup I've ended up with. The parking lights and projector fogs on yellow halogens and the headlights on blueish white HIDs. I still prefer to keep the halogens on the projector fogs but want to do something about the parking lights in reflectors. Suggestions welcome.

Outcome:

Without any lights. The mobile camera has increased exposure in this picture. It was a little darker in reality.

I agree the risk still exists. But it is certainly better to have a dealer who is willing to go the extra mile for you than one who is fussy about these things from the beginning. This dealer is part of the Advaith group who owns about 30 Hyundai showrooms in Karnataka. This easy-going attitude of theirs is evident across most of their service centers. Several months ago when I was very close to getting the Venue DCT at one of their dealers, they had offered me fitment of an after-market LED setup and had assured to take care of all warranty claims!

But again, I just hope I never get to find out.

The alternate option I had is to live with the stock setup until my extended warranty expires.",,,,,,,

I have also faced this in my GTX+ D AT and the rattling sound goes away when the seat is taken back to the original position. This is not a rattling from the rear parcel tray, my GTX has come with the rubber parts pre-installed in the rear parcel tray.

The biggest challenge I am facing is with LED headlights on high beam (even on separated highways where the beam is not concentrated, the throw is not good & not visible and hence not confidence-inspiring (probably I am more observant as being spoiled by my earlier ride ...

Kia had launched the Seltos with BS6 engines to compete with cars with BS4 engines (except few petrol cars from other OEMs which are already available with BS6 engines). Come next year, all cars would have some price hike due to the BS6 engine upgrade (anywhere between few thousands to the speculated few lakhs). So, that gives Kia some room to raise their prices as well while competing with the new launches.

I hope Kia doesn't become very greedy with the proposed hike and at the same time, work on their supply chain to improve delivery schedules.

Edit: Additional gizmos in the new models will also contribute to further price hike in other models. It's going to be a tough situation unless the BS6 upgrades doesn't turn out to be expensive for the OEMs as speculated earlier.",,,,,,,

Earlier this year, a video that surfaced Youtube showed a customer of Hyundai, who drove off her Elite i20 from the floorspace, thereby causing damage to the showroom as well as the car.

Now, in a new development, something similar has happened at a Kia dealership in Mumbai. Actually, some photos that have been circulating on the internet show a Kia Seltos that has fallen from the first floor of Panvel-based authorized dealership. It is being said this accident happened as one of the dealership executives tried parking the display unit in place. However, instead of slotting the gearlever into reverse, he mistakenly shifted to forward and ended up driving off the floor space. To make matters worse, the car hit another Kia Seltos parked outside the dealership. The second vehicle involved in this mishap seems to be a customer vehicle ready for delivery. As can be seen in the images, the crash is so severe that the driver’s airbag deployed. On the other hand, the red-coloured Seltos suffered from a damaged C-pillar and roof. Also, while this is clear case of negligence by the dealership staff, we’re happy that no one has got seriously hurt.

The Donut spare as opposed to a full sized spare is intentionally a size smaller, with noticable difference in handling and performance. It's thus a temporary replacement, expected to be changed once your regular tire is ready again. The smaller tire is an incentive to get your full sized repaired or replaced asap - you can't do much else with it and shouldn't drive too long on the Donut.",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"First a big thanks to the admins for approving my membership! Feels great to be a part of the Team-BHP family.

I had booked the Kia Seltos GTX Plus DCT Black variant in September and finally got the delivery on 2nd December from Joshi Kia in Chandigarh and I must say the delivery service was fantastic. I’m going to give the car for first service soon so I’ll update you all regarding my experience with after sales service as well. I’ll just quickly sum up my experience with the car so far with a few positive points and a few negatives that I noticed.

Positives:
1) The Drive: Kia really nailed it with the suspension. It’s just the perfect blend of comfort and stiffness. I’ve driven the car about 1k kms already (Can’t stop driving, help! ) and have taken it for a couple of highway runs. I’m happy to report that I got an average of 18.2 KMPL on the MID when I travelled from Gurgaon to Chandigarh in the early hours of the day and got about 17.6 KMPL while coming back from Gurgaon to Chandigarh during peak traffic hours through Delhi. In the city I’m getting about 12 KMPL. I had no issues with the DCT gearbox and I must say it is fabulous. I am fortunate enough to drive my Dad’s BMW 520D quite a lot and I don’t feel out of place at all while driving the Seltos which I believe is a big statement. The Steering also feels quite accurate.

2) The looks: This is one department that everyone is on the same page for Seltos . It is a stunner for sure. I’ve had a random person come up to me just to say, “Nice car”

3) More useful features , less Gimmicks:
The HUD, blind spot monitor, wireless charger and 360 camera are a boon while driving.

Negatives:

1) The Bose speakers sound great but there is a huge Rattling noise which comes from the front passenger door while listening to mid bass heavy songs like Bad guy by Billie Eilish. I think this issue is isolated to my car sadly and hopefully they fix it in the first service. Fellow BHPians do chime in if any of you
noticed door rattles on loud volumes with mid bass heavy songs and if there is any fix for this.

2) The driver side buttons aren’t illuminated. I guess I’ll get used to this eventually but they should’ve just added this in since they are on point with the interior quality besides this.

Overall I am pleased to have gone for this Crossover SUV and am a happy Customer so far. Here’s a couple of pictures of my beast :",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Quick 4.5k km update:

Recently took the car on a weekend trip to Icy Shimla. Covered around 700km round trip. I am not really a sedate driver so had pushed the car, whenever I could.

50% city; 30% highway; 20% Hills with FATC on 24deg returned me around 15.6kmpl T2T method.

The car behaved as expected, and we really enjoyed the drive. However, the only niggle was on the way to Shimla, the car kept going on its own to fresh-air circulation mode, even when the said automatic setting from the climate setting under vehicle settings was disabled. This really did my head on a 7 hour journey as I was having to constantly disable the fresh air mode. It worked absolutely fine though on the way back.

Also I saw too many Seltos all along the way! The front looks really stunning!",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"I'm seeing lot of Seltos these days, & my wife like it's headlights in particular. Past few days were hectic as I was busy taking turns at attending/ nursing a relative at city hospital & my wife would often visit hospital in evening (when it was dark outside). She did point to me about the new car with beautiful front end with lights coming on the opposite side or the LED tail lamps of GTX over the halogen lamps of the lesser variants (my neighbour bought top end diesel, after he sold his Innova). Yes she can differentiate between Harrier, Hector & Seltos (proud me ).

I believe I'm going to buy this or something similar in next 1-2 years as have no parking constraints now as compared to the period when I bought Figo Aspire Diesel 4 years ago.

However, one day I had not too good experience with a brash GTX driver who thought he could just force his way by barging into my right lane which forced to brake. I lost my composure & the #Badass in me immediately pressed the accelerator in my humble Aspire diesel. The Ford didn't disappoint & within 3 kms of fast driving & making way through maze of lane hogging stupid 2 & 3-wheelers he was behind me. With victory under my belt & ego pampered I rushed to hospital to brag the same to the patient who finally had a smile on his face (after some time being in & out of hospital).",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Did a 1208 kms roundtrip to Bangalore in brother's Seltos TGDi. Seltos handles very well and is sure footed in corners too. There is no nervousness and the chassis felt tight as a result of which one can take long sweeping curves at good speeds. Body roll is well contained too. With the Venue receiving positive feedback for handling, the Koreans are going in the right direction.

Ergonomics are spot on - all controls fall in reach comfortably. Both the front & rear seats are comfortable. Telescopic steering adjustment & seat height adjustment have good range - it's very easy to find a comfortable driving position. The ride quality is compromised because of the impractical 17"" profile - let's you know the surface if you are driving on roads with undulations. The mid/lower variants with 16"" profile will fare better. Goodyear tyres hinder performance - with better grippy rubber the Seltos would be even better to drive.

I have a change in opinion now. The above statement was made with ~50 kms in Chennai city traffic after 9 PM and the areas that I visited had flowing traffic mostly. After driving in Bangalore traffic (for ~ 200 kms) I can confirm that the lag would catch you off guard at times in bumper to bumper traffic - downside of a smaller displacement engine with big turbo.

TDGi picks up speed very rapidly and before one realises the speedo reaches 3 digits. The engine is very eager and looks like it can reach 200 kph. Thorughly enjoyed pushing it on the highways. It's very difficult to drive for mileage and ended up with average figures

80 @ 1800 rpm
90 @ 1900 rpm
100 @ 2000 rpm
110 @ 2250 rpm
120 @ 2500 rpm

There is a mild/soft beep @ 80 kph which becomes continuous after 120 kph. But the warning isn't annoying and music keeps it down.

Tank full to tank full mileage was 13 kpl - 40 ltrs consumed for 529 kms - This includes city driving and a trip to Chamundi hills.

Anna Nagar, Chennai to Basavangudi, Bangalore


Nandi hills roundtrip


Chamundi Hills roundtrip


Whitefield round-trip from Basavangudi. The turbo petrol fared well considering it was a peak hour drive


Basavangudi, Bangalore to Anna Nagar, Chennai


The time shown in these pics are the hours the engine has been running (including idle) during that particular trip.

Mileage is hampered to due traffic before entering the highway, for instance MID showed 14.9 kpl when we reached Electronic City and plummeted down to 13.6 kpl by the time we reached home in Basavangudi - a distance of ~20 kms took ~1.5 hours. I hadn't driven sedately during the entire trip and kept pushing the vehicle wherever, whenever I could. Pure highway mileage would be between 18 - 20 kpl.

Few random pics

View from Nandi Hills







I couldn't take enough pictures of the car since it was a family vacation.

Dislikes:

1. Seltos doesn't get sensor for entry from passenger side

2. Only the driver side power window switch is backlit, even the ORVM controls aren't back lit - very bad of Kia to ignore such minute yet important details.

3. Ride quality - with 17"" profile, it is one aspect that has been compromised in an otherwise complete package.

4. Turbo lag

5. I don't like the logo on the bonnet and feel it'll look better on the grill

Overall a very good car that gives a premium feel I found the Ecosport's (TDCi) steering, clutch and gearbox very hard to operate after 1.2K kms in Seltos",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Thank you moderators for approving my membership.
This is my first post and it’s is about my buying experience of Seltos HTX IVT

I had to replace my 12 year old swift. I was looking for the best fit since some time now.
When seltos was launched, I got this feeling that this is the right one to give up my swift for.
It was kind of a head vs heart fight one trying to convince the other. I was always against the idea of buying a newly launched car with in the first one year let alone from a new OEM. How did I convince myself?
1. Same platform as creta ( albeit it is for the next gen)
2. Same engines which would figure in BS6 creta.
3. It would be 6 months from launch by the time I get my vehicle and no major issues reported yet (except for a coolant overheating issue which seemed to be an isolated incident after my internet search)
4. I felt this is the best time to get a BS6 vehicle at the same price as BS4. Manufacturers might increase the prices during BS6 introduction and it would take some time for the prices to cool down.

Next decision: which variant?
My regular commute via Sarjapur Road (Bangalore) had my left leg crying for an automatic.
Factors that affected my variant selection
1. I was not confident to go for the DCT since the system is complex and I felt that the chances of something going wrong is higher with a complex system.
2. The driving discipline required for DCT in traffic was above my comfort limit.
3. Lesser fuel economy in the TGDI engine.
4. 90% of my driving is in Bangalore traffic and I don’t get to enjoy a high performance engine often even if I had one.
5. The 1.5L NA engine was good and responsive enough for my liking.
6. The automatic options in TGDI and diesel were expensive by almost 3 lakhs ( on road).
Finally decided it is going to be HTX IVT. The one thing I miss is the all black interiors.

Did my booking with JSP KIA Hosur Road. The booking experience was great. Did multiple test drives. He even let me take the vehicle for a longer drive to check bad road handling, experience drive off on a slope etc.. They mentioned the waiting time is 3 months but I got the vehicle in 5 weeks. No influence used. I guess it has to do with Kia’s vehicle allotment mechanism being random as mentioned in the thread before. Or perhaps the wait time has reduced now. Initially they asked if I was ok with a different colour. But when I declined he called again and said the vehicle is available but he wanted confirmation that the buying can be completed in 5 days. It’s their target it seems.
They brought the vehicle to the showroom for PDI once the loan was approved (initially they had requested me to do PDI at their yard which later changed to showroom)
The delivery experience was also good. It takes time if there is another delivery happening before yours since they do all the explanations about UVO and other stuff before the customer drives off the ramp. Never understood that logic but it was a 30 minutes wait which I felt was ok in the larger scheme.
I guess the post is already too long. I will write another post on my first impressions perhaps after a week.",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Folks,

My car is due for first free servicing, giving the car today. I have observed a weird problem with DCT which is scaring me. This happened twice yesterday while driving.

I started to drive normally and apparently the transmission was stuck in D2(gear 2) and not up-shifting on pressing accelerator even when RPM went upto 3500 and beyond. It was appearing as if it got stuck in this gear. This happened for the first time after driving the car for a month. I checked the drive mode and it was in normal mode only. I parked the car,switched off the engine and then restarted the engine and then things were fine. However, while returning from office in the evening, the same thing happened again. After repeating the same(engine on, off), the car then behaved fine.

The same that has been discussed in this thread before. Shift to neutral if you anticipate the stop to be more than 10 seconds. Avoid creeping in slow moving traffic by letting the vehicle in front to move a short distance before moving your vehicle. I am not sure how to do that with a lot of two wheelers waiting to occupy those spaces",,,,,,,

To add to that if the transmission does give a warning that it is overheated and needs to be cooled, where in Sarjapur road/ORR traffic can you even imagine to pull over and park the car to the side.

The dry clutch DCT is definitely one to really think over if the point of getting the automatic is to use in peak hour traffic like Bangalore's.

The IVT and Diesel 6AT are far safer bets in the long run.

The 7DCT will definitely wow you initially but it remains to be seen how it fares after 3-4 years of use in this traffic which will only get worse.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Took delivery of my HTX IVT about a week back after a 3 month long wait. My original colour preference was white with orange roof but the dealer said it won't come anytime soon. So i took the white & plan to do a roof wrap later

The dealer tried his best to make me take insurance with them - they have a mark up of 40% (Rs 52000+ with the dealer & Rs 37000+ if I take it with Royal sundaram agent). After a couple of days of calls & threats to expose them on social media, I finally convinced them to allow me to take insurance outside.

Yesterday i drove on ECR & had a chance to check out the sports mode. Was pleasantly surprised to find that it had a 8 speed gearbox. Not sure even if the salesman & service advisors are aware of this as the service advisor said that it was a 6 speed gearbox

Actually HTX IVT doesn't have drive modes like GTX but when you shift the gearbox to manual mode (the + & - signs on the right side of the gear lever), the indication in the display is ""S"" which i guess means ""Sports"" mode",,,,,,,

Yes, I guess if we switch to manual mode (and until you press + or -) the cluster shows S or S1 .... S7 depending upon the automatic transmission used. The gear numbers are suffixed with S in the scenario of DCT and the behavior is not exactly same as normal/eco mode and is more of a ""sports"" mode.

Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Took a KIA Seltos(1.5 P - Manual HTK) for a weekend drive. Came back super impressed.

Suspension/Chassis is very good. It just dismissed all the potholes. Had to brake hard and steer left to avoid a stray dog and car was in absolute control.
Minimal body roll around the corners. Did not get tired after driving 4 hours. Full marks to KIA here. It drove like a European car.

Refinement is top notch - No noise/vibration inside the cabin. Also loved the shifter. It was super sleek and a delight to use. Clutch effort was also spot on.

Air conditioning was very effective. Apple CarPlay was a delight to use and the Headunit was sleek and very responsive.

Engine pulled cleanly from as low as 1200 rpm in 5th gear.

Two negatives :
1. I feel that the engine would only suit a sedate driver. It just doesn't have a sense of urgency. Overtakings in Highway needs to be planned. It has no punch in mid range.

Note that I drive 1.5 Diesel Ford everyday. So my comparison is with that.
2. Neck support was not good - Poor Design of headrest maybe ?!

It took her 32 days from booking to delivery along with countless visits to the showroom to achieve this.

* This is the HTX Manual Diesel version
* Definitely a head turner.
* It is comfortable and practical at the same time.
* The Diesel engine is silent, even from the outside.
* There is a load of features available.
* The Blue and Orange colour is hard to get, but not impossible.
* I am 5.6"" and used to drive a MS Ritz. I felt that the clutch travel is bit longer than that you find in the regular MS vehicles.
* I felt that the Ingress - Egress movement is more like that of a sedan than an SUV. Learnt it the hard way after multiple head bangs while getting in.

Though I'm not a Seltos owner, I've watched in Karan sir's review of the GTX+ DCT that the drive modes actually affect the way the gearbox responds. What drive mode have you selected when it goes through the ramp?",,,,,,,

Have been driving the 1.4 GTX+DCT for a week now including one rush hour drive through the Outer Ring Road in Bengaluru. I have been driving in the normal mode all through.

The gear box is obsessed with D2 (second gear). It shifts up from D1 almost as soon as the car moves and does not shift to D1 even at speeds as low as 5 kmph. Only full stop braking seems to make it shift down to D1.

As it stays in D2 it slips the clutch (like we would drive a manual transmission by riding half clutch!!!) a lot. The clutch slip is more pronounced in an incline. It is programmed like this possibly for smoothness and fuel economy.

I beleive this is one of the reasons (perhaps a key reason) for heating and the hesitation mentioned above.

Using the techniques described in this thread (full stop vs crawl, create space with vehicle in front, move to neutral etc) I have managed to keep the transmission temperature well below the half way mark.

The engine + gearbox is super smooth when driving in low traffic situation.

Till now, I have really liked the car. Coming from my previous diesel car, the quietness and refinement is wonderful. I like the ride and handling too. Looking forward to the first long drive to Bhadra and Chickmagalur next week!!!

The booking to delivery experience with Naara Kia was very good.

That's actually a huge blessing, compared to say, the car grunting and jiggling like a hippo on 1st, till 10/20. The dumb torque converters all operate like that.

In anycase, affordable automatic transmissions are a failed experiment, not one decent one out there that seamlessly shifts (with zero noise/shake), the torque converter is hugely reliable but dumb as a rock, CVT is a rubber band slowcoach.. revs revving up the moon but speed not even comparable, and DSGs quick, intelligent and predictive but an overheating diva.

I for one always prefer first gear to take the car above jogging speeds. Given the torque curves of modern turbo cars, it is a lot easier on the mechanicals if the 1st to 2nd gearshift happens at 15-20kmph and not at, say 5kmph. First gear is not there just for show after all, I don't know why so many people tend to be afraid of letting the engine rev even a little bit in first. It is anyday more desirable than lugging the engine in second at low rpm.

Agree, most ATs under 20L are rather unintelligent. I suppose that has more to do with the good people who developed the shifting logic not having much experience with Indian traffic. Add to that, not everyone provides a proper 'Sports' mode or paddle shifts to quicken things up when needed. DSGs to me remain a risky bet for long term ownership, especially as someone who uses his cars for a decade and likes to go touring with family. I'd rather stick to my torque converters. And all doubters of TCs need to experience the brilliance that is the PPG sourced 6 speed on the Hexa. It is in my book the most intelligent and best executed automatic transmission on this side of the legendary ZF 8 speed.",,,,,,,

When I drove manual, I used to be in 5th by 50, easily and 1-2 at 5 kph, of course it was 100% city traffic but even at the ton mark (very rare) I used to keep it at around 2k revs. I hate the feeling of an elephant sitting on the car at 1st gear or while even pushing the car at higher revs at lower speed, my sole aim is to keep the revs under 2k at all times. This is why I cringe when people say high revving engine, can push to 7k RPM, etc.. when someone starts praising VTEC I run from them SO fast. In automatics, the clutch desigm itself has to be changed, else that first gear is an enemy. I'd program a gyroscope software into the DSG, where 1 kicks in only when the car has a substantial incline to face, else it should be 2 from speed 0.

All I need from any automatic transmission is torque, billions of neuton meters of it. Not that I intend to race or drive sportily, but I want power on tap, no grunting, no jiggling and no panting.. the Audi had it (DCT), the Hyundais have it (worst torque converters ever), VW TSI engines have it.. I hated every automatic I've driven till date including many cars that have been praised endlessly here. Nothing comes a mile close to what my right and left foot can do.

The Kona is the car for my needs, it delivered oodles of torque till 80 and from the get go (that's all I need). Unfortunately that car has other problems.",,,,,,,

I had read about this type of problem in DSGs where the gearbox would give false neutrals meaning it won't move ahead even though it shows to be in gear. Was your car stuck in D2 and moving forward as the revs built and only failing to upshift? What happened when you stopped the car? Did it go back to D1? Were you able to shift it to N? This seems to be like a case of false neutral to me. For DSGs the fix back then was changing the gear box temperature control sensor. Hopefully Kia has a solution for you, but in no way should you take it lightly. If they ask you to reproduce the event and it doesn't happen in one go, don't try to strain the machine further. Something on the electronics side if at all can fix this issue, why put mechanical strain on components? Would suggest taking up the issue to Kia officials on email. Every such sporadic fault should log an error report in the memory. When they scan, make sure they don't erase error codes without showing them to you first.",,,,,,,

dark.knight has a very valid point there. First gear is very rarely needed. In fact when I used to drive my good old Ambassador in the 70s and 80s I never used the 1st gear unless I was on a steep incline. On level ground, I used to start from 2nd gear and move up to 3rd as the speed crossed about 20 KMPH.",,,,,,,

This made me laugh

Well said , What you are referring to is Effortless acceleration, it needs power at lower engine speeds, no doubt. I find iVtec to be very difficult in the city, keeps my left foot busy, I'm sure there are fans for that sort of thing too.

While I find Hexa's auto transmission to be very smooth for a relaxed drive, VW DSG makes their diesel engines feel more diesely , Honda's CVT converts the car into a blender, all in the name of convenience. Nothing can beat the smoothness a good engine + manual gearbox can deliver, power when you need it , super smooth if you know how.

What Hyundai/ KIA is doing here is to fix a problem in the only way they can given current circumstances. They sure cannot make the engine bigger, so make a transmission that makes up for it. DCT is perhaps their best bet on this front.

Meanwhile, you can have a small engine, hardly any power on paper, heavy vehicle and still have a good second gear = Bolero Power+",,,,,,,

It shifted to D2 and held that gear. It did not upshift but revved as I pressed the throttle. Tried triptonic but gears did not upshift or downshift. Could put it in neutral and then subsequently to park. Restarted the engine and the gears were in order. No issues now. Have to take the car to service centre.",,,,,,,

Although UVO is a great feature, this is annoying, even mine (GTX+ D AT) is not getting updated since Dec 18, which means I also need to visit Service Center to get the update!

Kia should get a better process to let the update sent over the air or find out a way that current setups continue to work even with a previous version till the time user visits service station for next service.

BTW, would like to share that I have noted that the UVO app does show the tyre in red colour in ""Status"" if Air pressure in that tyre is below pre-set limit which looks to be 28-29 (other tyres continue to be shown is green). Although they should have set the limit little lower which is a problem in cold weather since as soon as a tyre touches this value the TPMS throws an error and you need to through the complete cycle of over-inflating and delating to desired levels.

Apologies for the back to back posts. Found the source of the chime, it's the speed limit audible warning. I had enabled speed limit on navigation setting (it's not checked by default) and forgot about it. Fun fact: speed limit on bellandur stretch of ORR is 40 KMPH.

High-quality materials are used everywhere and the cabin feels premium, ergonomics were spot on for me and I was very comfortable driving it from the word go. My daily drive is humble & small Santro but somehow the bigger size & higher driving position of Seltos didn't intimidate me.
2 weeks back I had taken a test drive of Creta petrol automatic. Even though Creta has it's positives but I never found a perfect driving position in it & ergonomics were a bit amiss. The interiors didn't feel that premium. The driving experience was not that great. Even with 1 Lakh discount on Creta, If I were on the market to buy SUV, I would rather go for Seltos than Creta. When you are shelling out 16+ a lakh more doesn't matter much for a product which one would love to own, isn't it?
I also drove a GTX Petrol DCT after driving HTX IVT. The difference due to the DCT gearbox & Turbocharged petrol engine was immediately felt. The Sports mode put a big smile on my face . It immediately reminded me of my Linea Tjet; Seltos is more powerful.
I didn't get a chance to listen to the Bose audio system as they didn't have any vehicle with it. The Infinity music system is so good that I thought I was listening to a Bose. Definitely much better than the one offered in Creta.

The Information Tech professor who taught me was obsessed with Data harvesting, so obsessed that she can't go 2 sentences without taking that word. She like many others keep saying that data is the next goldmine/oilmine. There are umpteen adverts on internet today about becoming a data analyst and now even programming machines to analyze and mine data (A.I).

Inventing these terms, to me is something to the tune of calling a drug peddler a ""Fantasy Scientist"" or a burglar as a ""Randomized Item Logistics and Resale Manager"". The Internet of Things (IoT) is there to study everyone, period. Smart is the new dumbing of us, and is one step closer to using the mined data to manipulate the users more and more and more till they are just a zombie connected to the smart grid.

People like my professor are victims of their trade, where they've become so distant and so disconnected from reality, because their aim is to create a new VR, where data is exchanged for apparent ""free"" services, the real cost, we will understand soon.

My UVO isnt working since Dec 18, as well and this is the 2nd time this has happened. The last time also I had to reset the system using instructions from YT, and I wasnt happy about losing all my settings then. I am not sure if the update solves the issue or will it be just another reset done by the dealer. Eitherway it is frustrating and OTA updates should happen, as there is no reason why that would be a difficult task to do. It will also give the car a USP besides the Hector has it already.

But a lot of time, you can't move at all. You'll be standing still in long jams, especially during water logging. So driving in manual mode in 1st gear will not be an option in such case.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,UVO app in my Seltos wasn't working since 25th Nov and I called Kia customer care and tweeted them. After couple of tweets and 2 weeks later got a call from CC that an upgrade is available and can be done by visiting SC/Dealer. Went to dealer today and the SA simply reset and i have lost all my data from 25th Nov to today. Is this how the updates be done/these guys aren't aware of it. Is there a way I can get the data back for that period?,,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"I find these frequent updates extremely irritating. It's great that we are getting regular updates, but a pain having to take the car to the dealer/service centre so often.
Also if an update is released, why should the system stop working? Just trying to imagine if every time Apple releases an iOS update, all their devices stop working till updated.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,kia seltos,,"Hey guys, I picked up the Seltos GTX+ DCT. I placed my order back in July when they started taking preorders, switched the variant from GTX to GTX+ when they announced it.



I placed my order in Vijayawada, not really sure what happened but for some reason the blue color that I've wanted wasn't being allocated in the variant that I've picked. I even wrote to Kia regarding the delay in my delivery but I never got a reply. I keep shuffling between Hyderabad and Vijayawada, so I also inquired at the Hyderabad showroom in November and even they said they don't have a timeline for the Orange/blue color. The sales representative was kind enough to call me last week saying they did receive a blue variant that I've wanted. I called the Vijayawada dealership who then blocked the car in Hyderabad and requested for a transfer. Both the dealers helped out of their way to make the process smooth and I'm glad that they did.

Fortunately this isn't the only car in the stable, so I was fine with the 4.5 months of delay.

I wanted to replace the rubber to something better and I ended up with the 235/55/17 Michelin Primacy 4 ST with 32psi. Even though I didn't drive much on either of the two tires, I could feel the improved ride quality as soon as I switched. For all Seltos owners, even at the stock size, I would recommend the switch to a better quality rubber.



All the likes and dislikes have been posted multiple times in this thread, so I will post some quick first impressions from family, friends and my crew.
Compliments for the blue color, almost everyone liked it.
The first thing my wife said as soon as she started driving was ""the engine is so smooth"". This was also said by my other family member and a friend.
One driver said, these seats will get dirty quick, why didn't you go for black seats?
Seating posture is good for my family and a mother of a newborn with her kid in her arms liked the posture in the rear seat as well. I don't personally use the rear seat at all but I'm glad the position is good.
Everyone's impressed by the quality of interiors, I don't think any of them expected the car to look the way it does outside and inside.
My friend Bhuvan from TeamBHP drove the car yesterday and he liked what's on offer. The transmission though not as smooth or quick as a DSG, does a decent job.
Family likes the air purifier option, they think it is much needed in today's day and age. I also did notice the air quality index increasing drastically where there are more buses than the usual.


Things I wish that were different from the 48 hours I've had the car -
Why not give a black interior option? I picked the top variant for the addition features but I would have really liked and enjoyed the black interiors.
How could you skip backlit keys on a 20L car? I literally had to turn the interior light on to find the unlock button last night. This is just unacceptable.
Memory seats, I wish they gave this as an option and I wouldn't mind paying extra for it either. In India cars are used by other people and memory seat would have been very convenient for me, I'm 6'4 and it is quite a process to adjust the seat multiple times a day.
The thigh support is lacking. I'm not expecting extended thigh support but I felt the length of the seat under the thighs is a tad short than the usual. Will have to see how the posture will play on my knees on a road trip.
Too much chrome for my taste, I will probably black out the front chrome over the period of time.

That pretty much sums up the two day ownership. I want to drive the car more but due to work and a busy week, I haven't been able to. Hoping to get some extended drives over the next few weeks.

Merry Christmas!",,,,,,,

It's not compulsory but they try to make you take insurance with them as they have margins on it. My dealer also tried to force me to take insurance with them but I resisted as their mark up was more than 40% when compared to market rates

But i fought with them & after 2 - 3 days of negotiations, I was allowed to take insurance outside. But dealer requested me to take extended warranty (I wasn't willing to do so initially) & I obliged as I didn't want to prolong the issue

I gave a lot of consideration to HTK+ variant, but even the HTK will cost above 12 lakhs OTR post price increase. Other than pricing, HTK+ doesn't come with auto climate control. That was the only feature for which I would have plonked the extra money, but both HTK/HTK+ gets the same HVAC system i.e. manual. Other features like alloy wheels, cruise control, push-button start, auto-folding ORVMs, ambient lights etc are nice to have but not worth nearly 2 lakhs of the price difference between the two variants.

My original colour choice in the family was orange but the dealer was not willing to take booking of that colour citing availability reasons. The same thing was quoted for blue colour. I personally don't like orange but Anyways, we chose the evergreen red color. I liked the Seltos in black color as well, but Kia has restricted black to HTX and above variants.

As of now, I have only received a booking confirmation message with a reference number. What's next? Will I be able to track the status? How I will get to know that car has been allotted? What as a customer I need to do during waiting period?

The HTK is very well loaded and one of the most VFM.

On the other hand, the missing ACC on the HTK+ is a crime.

Orange and Blue are low in demand. Hence KIA is manufacturing them less frequently leading to longer waiting periods. They are producing and promoting the fast moving colors.
These colors are like the Optional variants of Maruti cars! Persist with your SA and you will get it.

Just my 2 Paisa,

1) if you can wait, wait for the BS6 new 2020 Creta. The launch is a matter of months away

2) Seltos > current bs4 Creta so if I may ask, why not the Seltos?

Even I was looking at a Creta but the kit that is offered on the Seltos is far superior to the Creta (variant to comparable variant that is) and Hyundai still doesn't offer deep discounts so in my case the diesel HTX+ manual Seltos actually was cheaper than the top end Creta diesel manual and I saw no value in going for an older platform, bs4 and lesser kit.

To answer your specific question though, you should look at the HTK+ auto. Even the otr is very similar in Chennai though if am not mistaken this has more kit than the SX(O) auto variant in Creta.",,,,,,,

I didn't opt for the unlimited mileage extended warranty as it was about Rs 4000 more. I opted for the 4th & 5th year with 125000 km warranty

Seltos is definitely better if you can pu up with the waiting period. I picked up Petrol IVT for about Rs 16.65 L in Chennai. But prices likely to go up from Jan 1st.

But the advantages are the BS6 engine & UVO connectivity & loads of other features. You will definitely get discounts on the Creta but it's a BS4 engine.

What you'll like:

• Handsome Cherokee-inspired styling & loads of character
• Solid build. Feels very robust, just as a Jeep should
• 1.4L turbo-petrol makes 161 BHP! Offers fast performance
• Smooth 7-speed dual-clutch Automatic
• Mature suspension setup, nicely-tuned EPS & rock-solid stability
• City-friendly size & higher seating make the Compass AT incredibly easy to drive
• Structurally safe, all-wheel disc brakes and a whole host of electronic aids (including ESP)
• We think the Compass is well-priced for what it offers

What you won't:

• 1.4L Petrol motor simply isn't as impressive as the all-rounded 2.0L Diesel
• No sport mode, no paddle shifters and no cruise control for this AT
• Petrol AT is unavailable in the lower variants. No AWD or 6 Airbags like the Diesel either
• Complex dual-clutch ATs have usually been troublesome in India
• Small size for the price! Also, narrow cabin is suitable for 4 adults, not 5
• Tiny dealership network. After-sales quality & long-term reliability are unknown factors as well
• Turning radius of 5.65m is more than the Safari Storme's. Further, 17º approach angle is too low

VAG cars proudly brag about their dual-clutch credentials on the gear lever (example image) - there's no such mention of the DDCT on the Jeep:


AWD unavailable on the petrol. Lack of the AWD knob frees up this small storage space in front of the gear lever:


Foot well looks less cramped due to the missing clutch pedal, but in a car where your left leg lies idle, the dead pedal is placed far too ahead. It should have been more sunken in. Good dead pedals are all the most important in an AT than an MT as your left leg is permanently on it. Petrol AT owners will hate this awkwardly placed dead pedal & tall owners will have their left leg resting in a crooked position:",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,Jeep Compass,,"FCA's MultiAir Technology



The Compass Petrol is powered by a 1,368cc, 4-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine that makes 161 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 250 Nm of torque @ 2,500 - 4,000 rpm. This engine is also the first from FCA India to get MultiAir tech.

The first MultiAir engine was developed back in 2009. An electro-hydraulic system is used to control the air intake. This eliminates the need for a conventional butterfly throttle body. There are narrow tunnels / passages that connect the intake valves to the camshaft (these are filled with hydraulic fluid). An electric solenoid actuates this system. When the solenoid is closed, the cam's movements are passed on to the intake valves by the hydraulic fluid that can't be compressed. When open, the valves are free to close through the conventional valve springs. This electro-hydraulic link allows near independent operation of the two systems and an almost infinite control for opening of the intake valves based on the driving conditions & accelerator input.



MultiAir was primarily designed to provide five different responses depending on the driving conditions. At idle, the intake valve is opened partially by closing the solenoid. This causes the air to rush into the combustion chamber, causing greater turbulence & leading to better combustion. For low rpm torque, the solenoid engages at the end, closing the valve early. This reduces undesirable back flow into the intake manifold and fills the cylinder with the maximum air possible improving the efficiency. At partial loads, the solenoid opens early to finetune the amount of air volume, to deliver the required torque. During stop and go traffic conditions, the multi-lift mode is used. Here, the intake valve is opened twice during each intake stroke for better combustion at low loads. In the full lift mode, maximum power is provided for highway driving. The solenoid remains closed causing the camshaft to produce the maximum valve lift. While these are the five modes used, there are almost infinite levels of continuously variable valve lift profiles.

Other variable valve technologies like Honda's iVtec offer 2 cam profiles, one for lower rpm and another at the higher end, while BMW's Valvetronic Variable Valve Lift System (VANOS) uses far more sophisticated + expensive systems for achieving the same result. The BMW system allows the valve timing and lift to be varied, but not the cam profile - which is possible in the MultiAir. However, the most unique feature of the MultiAir is the fact that it can be retrofitted to existing engines - thus, when launched, Fiat didn't have to design an entire engine from scratch. They just replaced the camshaft of the existing engine with this system on the intake side!

The company claims a 10% reduction of CO2 emissions, a 10% increase in engine power and a 15% increase in engine torque over conventional engines.

Here is a short explanatory video:

The 7-speed DDCT



The 7-speed Dual Dry Clutch Transmission (DDCT) is available in the Compass Petrol AT. This gearbox is internally known as FPT C725 DDCT - the 7 stands for the number of gears and the 25 denotes the torque limit of 250 Nm. Since it has a limit of 250 Nm, the same will be available only on the petrol variant. This gearbox is suitable for front wheel drive layouts only. It was developed in 2003 by the joint venture between Fiat and GAC, and is currently manufactured at Iveco Automotive Transmission Co. Ltd. in Hangzhou, China. The other models that use this transmission are the Fiat Ottimo, Fiat Viaggio and Jeep Renegade - available only in China.

The gearbox consists of four sub-assemblies = base gearbox, an electro-hydraulic actuation system, a transmission control unit and dual clutch unit + clutch actuators. Fiat Powertrain Systems designed them in a modular fashion which ensured that the future gearbox designs are cost efficient. The electro-hydraulic actuation systems though redesigned, feature a standardized mounting system to the base gearbox.

The C725 gets an electro-hydraulic clutch and gear selection mechanism. Magneti Marelli-sourced hydraulic actuation systems and control units are used in this gearbox. They are housed in a single module - the mechatronic control module (MCM). This ensures that the gearbox is an independent standalone unit. The MCM gets a dedicated, lifelong sealed hydraulic oil circuit that is used to actuate the clutches and gear shifting mechanisms.

This is how the MCM looks:


And its integration with the gearbox:


The gearbox gets two output shafts, one longer than the other. The longer one houses gears 1, 3, 5, 7 and reverse while the other has 2, 4 and 6. The parking pawl is located on the longer output shaft as well. The two clutches have odd & even gears associated with them. The odd clutch is actuated using a coaxial pull rod mechanism, while the even one uses a conventional hydraulic mechanism. The actuator for the pull rod is located at the rear of the transmission. The odd gear clutch is normally closed while the even gear clutch is normally open. Fiat also claims that using certain design parameters, the total oil required has been reduced to under 2 litres.

A cutout image of the clutch control systems:


The gearbox weighs about 74 kg (dry); that's around 10 kg more than the Volkswagen 7-speed DQ200.

Not much is known about this gearbox, but it should be noted that the other 9-Speed AT gearboxes from Jeep (particularly the ZF ones) are plagued with problems. We'll keep our fingers crossed on its long-term reliability. It is important to note that VW's DSG & Ford's DCT have both suffered reliability issues in India.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,Jeep Compass,,"Driving the 1.4L MultiAir Automatic

161 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 250 Nm @ 2,500 - 4,000 rpm:


Get into the car and press the starter button with the brake depressed to wake up the turbo-petrol. There is a hint of cabin shake on startup - accentuated by the fact that one doesn't expect this from a petrol engine. Some aspects of this motor are obviously similar to that of the Fiat Linea 125S & Abarth Punto. It can be said that it is the same old T-Jet engine, but now with MultiAir tech. As told in the previous post, the technology is responsible for the bump up in power figures.

The Compass DDCT is a compact, good-looking petrol SUV with an automatic gearbox. This combo will definitely appeal to the urban dweller, more so due to the limited options offering this combination in the price band. Further, the light steering and tall seating position make it a breeze to drive in the city. The engine is audible inside the cabin, but it's not loud at idle. Slot into D, disengage the parking brake and lift off the brake pedal to move. Without any accelerator input, the car creeps at 7 km/h. This is very useful in stop and go traffic which you can tackle with just the brake pedal. On accelerating, the car upshifts to 2nd after 10 km/h. The extremely short 1st gear is used only to get the Compass rolling from a standstill. With an easy foot, the gearbox is smooth and most drivers will notice the gearshifts only when they watch the MID (gear indicator) or rev counter.

Starting off from a standstill is smooth and seamless, and it has more than enough power for city usage. Within the city, in traffic, the Compass seems to love the 2nd and 3rd ratios - good in terms of power delivery as you will be in the power band, but not in terms of FE (some ATs shift up quicker). The experience is overall smooth. However, it must be noted that the gearbox can at times get dimwitted in stop and go conditions where the speeds wildly vary. It can take too long to choose the right gear, or at times, persist in the wrong gear for a couple of seconds before selecting the right one. If you suddenly kickdown the accelerator in traffic, there are times when there is no response for 1-1.5 and at times 2 seconds, after which the turbo spools, the gearbox shifts down and you get a sudden surge of power with accompanying torque steer . This can take getting used to, especially when closing traffic gaps or during quick overtakes. The lack of a torque converter on the gearbox only adds to the delay; the gearbox doesn't conceal turbo lag. In terms of FE, drive it hard and it will guzzle fuel - unlike the Diesel ATs, Petrol ATs are very sensitive to FE & aggressive driving (ARAI number is 14.1 km/l).

When you are at a traffic light and engage P, the electronic parking brake automatically engages. When the lights go green, slotting in D mode with the brake pedal pressed makes the electronic parking brake automatically disengage. This is convenient & good for the gearbox's health too - if you park on an incline in a regular AT, the gearbox pin bears the stress. In the Compass, there is no load on the parking pin, as the handbrake is engaged automatically. However, what is not cool is that every time you drive off after restarting the car, you have to manually disengage the electronic brake. This can be disabled (auto e-park brake setting), but we don't recommend it. What Jeep should have rather done is that, with the foot on the brake and gear in D mode, the parking brake should have automatically disengaged (even when you've just started the car).

Keep the heat on the accelerator and the Compass Petrol will deliver fast performance on the highway, it'll munch miles quickly and you will easily set a healthy pace. The power & torque figures are excellent and no owner will be left wanting in this area. Still, you have to work this engine hard to extract the most out of it - power delivery isn't as effortless as in the diesel. With pedal-to-the-metal driving, the gearbox upshifts at just under 6,000 rpm. The final 5% of the accelerator has a kickdown mode - you can feel it with your foot and hear a mild click when you engage it. You have to press the accelerator all the way in for kickdown mode, and when you do so, the gearbox will aggressively downshift not just one or two gears, but at times even three. However, be mindful of the delay of 1-2 seconds sometimes - especially when you are overtaking. At high rpm, you will hear the engine in the cabin, but it won't cause annoyance. Although I must add, the 1.4L MultiAir is 'boomier' than you would expect in a Rs. 25 lakh car. The engine note is alright, yet certainly not what us enthusiasts would call a 'sweet enjoyable sound'. The tall 7th gear means that the Compass Petrol AT is extremely relaxed at expressway speeds. 100 km/h comes up at just 1,950 rpm, while the engine ticks over at just under 2,300 rpm at 120 km/h. And at this point, the engine is right in the turbo zone. The mid-range of this motor is punchy and overtaking is easy. The 7th gear engages only after you reach speeds of 90-95 km/h, but on the way down, it will hold 7th till about 77 km/h before shifting to 6th.

What you will undoubtedly miss on the highway are paddle shifters. At this price point, Jeep should have given us paddle shifters as they are immensely useful on highways, and when you're driving spiritedly. Because there aren't any paddles, you have to take your hand off the steering wheel for manual mode.

Move the gearlever to the left for manual mode - push up to downshift and pull down to upshift (we prefer it the other way around). In manual mode, the engine revs to 6,500 rpm. When it reaches there, it will not upshift to the next gear. We like this better than other ATs which upshift automatically at the redline - that can catch you out in a fast corner! It's a different matter with downshifts where manual mode is way too conservatively tuned for a petrol. It wouldn't even allow me a downshift from 4th gear at 3,800 rpm into 3rd. Heck, there are some diesels out there which allow this!! It should be noted that downshifts in manual mode are almost instantaneous, but the upshifts take slightly longer. Jeep has missed the opportunity to provide a 'Sport' mode on the AT, which owners would undoubtedly use more often than manual mode on the highway.

What catches you unawares is the torque steer! When climbing a ghat at full throttle, the torque steer in 2nd & 3rd got tricky as I had to concentrate on the corner as well as steering corrections to control the torque steer. Flooring it in 3rd, torque steer is definitely more than we expected from a 161 BHP car. It is lesser if you are accelerating from 0-100 km/h - i.e. running away from a standstill, but the torque steer comes in stronger when you are cruising and suddenly floor the accelerator - there is a sudden burst of power.

Overall, we'll say that the Petrol engine does the job, but it doesn't impress like the 2.0L diesel did. The Compass diesel has a jewel of an engine; it makes more power as well as torque. We look forward to the upcoming Diesel AT variant. Even the Petrol AT's gearbox is strictly average. On paper, 7 gears & dual-clutch tech puts it on par with VW's DSG, although in the real world, it can't match the speed & intelligence of the DSG. There's no comparison.

The laden ground clearance of the petrol version is 151 mm. That is 1 mm more than the diesel 4x2, but 4 mm lesser than the diesel 4x4. The Compass petrol gets 4 wheel disc brakes like the diesel. Even on the AT (lesser engine braking), we found the brakes to be satisfactory.

Sweeeeeet feature - even when you are driving in ""D"" mode, the MID tells you what gear is engaged (D1, D2...). Us enthusiasts always like to know what gear the car is in, but rarely do AT cars give us that data:


In ""M"" mode, you get suggestions for upshifts and downshifts, both:

Whether in ""D"" or in Manual Mode, the selected gear is displayed on the MID:

Most ATs get a visible 'shift lock' button. To access the one of the Compass, the gear lever boot must be pulled off and a screwdriver inserted into a slot below. What is it for? Pressing this button bypasses the gear lock system whereby you cannot move out of position ""P"" unless the key is inserted and the brake pedal is pressed. Use the shift lock button when you park on an incline and can’t move the lever out of ""P"". The feature could also be used when towing the vehicle (vehicle breakdown):",,,,,,,

Crisp and short summary GTO! Thanks. .

If I were looking for one, I'd pick the Creta petrol AT. It is incredibly refined the torque converter does not feel all that bad! Wish it becomes available in the SX(o) trim once the facelift arrives. That said - Good thing then that Jeep is not using this gearbox in the upcoming diesel AT variant which should prove to be a more popular offering in the market as compared to the thirsty petrol AT.

Also - any way the petrol manual variant will be better to drive than the AT? Manual is offered in the base Sport trim. With all the torque steer and predictable handling - should be a much better machine with a manual gearbox.",,,,,,,

Expected the turbo petrol and a 7 speed Dual Clutch on a vehicle like the Compass to be a sweet package and an AT that would be enjoyable to drive. Disappointing to see it is not as accomplished as one would expect and missing both sports mode as well as paddle shifts is a downer.

Still a good choice to have and I expect it to do well.

The BMW VANOS isn't what I'd call ultra reliable. If it shows signs of failing (excess noise), it is time you think of selling the car. For what seems to be an even more complex system, the MultiAir has been reliable. No questions about Honda's iVtec.

It is pretty evident that the foundation block of this engine is the age old 1.4 Fire series from Fiat. The MultiAir version is heavily reworked internally, slapped with an ultra modern intake and fuel injection system, an intercooler and turbocharger. However; there is no taking away some aspects and that is the dull bottom end response which applies even to the NA 1.4l. Yes; you should ideally get past this with a turbo but that ain't the case. The T Jet suffers from annoying lag too.

To me this sounds like some protective measure to not kill the gearbox. Thats within the zone where the engine is pushing peak torque so maybe it is a case of saving the shift mechanism, bearings, etc. Hard to say unless the designers themselves spoke about why they keep such limitations.

On one side you have the brilliant dsg which in my books trumps even the ZF's on BMW's. The trade off being the gearbox might fall apart at any time. Then you have Ford and ""Other"" systems that are also dual clutch but are no match to the dsg when it comes to speed. Reliabilty is also suspect.

The quality of the drive is further assisted by the excellent 1.8l engine. The Toyota 1.8l is a solid NA engine with brilliant bottom end even by todays standards. Probably the reason why they continue to use this engine in pretty much every corner of the world. No tiny turbo petrol can match the bottom end of this engine.

FCA really need to offer this brilliant petrol in manual top trim. I bet that will shave off almost 2 lacs straight. This AT is almost 24-25 lac car. I would start to veer towards an Octavia Tsi.",,,,,,,

I beg to differ here, this is very misleading. BMW VANOS & Valvetronic is in production since early 2000s and applied across all BMW gasoline engines. Even the latest B38, 1.2L engine applied with Valvetronic which is in MINI and also PSA applied the same in Prince 1.6L in Europe. MultiAir is applied only in expensive FIAT cars. No other customer got them so far in production. Reliability in just few cars Vs whole family of Gasoline engines in BMW is not a fair comparison! Perhaps, this may be one off case with your experience but definitely Valvetronic & MultiAir are world apart!

This is the piece I was personally interested to know from the review here. Based on the industry study & literature, 0.5 second interruption between gear shifts in AT is acceptable and mostly not perceptible by many drivers. For a dual clutch AT, where the fundamental design objective is to have the shift quicker due to independent clutches for each bank of gears, does not seem to be right to take 1 ~ 2 seconds. And so, on the contrary, one could doubt the engine's MultiAir system, which essentially hinders the aspiration of the engine. The technology, undoubtedly great! However, it needs to be tuned for faster response. There're so many hidden stuff going on in the background when you floor the pedal or let go smoother.

Here's what happens in little bit of technical details: Host of sensor inputs checked at the ECU and it selects the right combination of valve lift / timing to satisfy the need of the Torque Demand (Pedal input is converted into Torque Demand). And as it was explained in this review, there are many systems need to act fast: The cam input is being taken but converted into hydraulic stiffness and again the amount of oil determines the valve lift / timing and coupled with the solenoid actuation. Most of the solenoid valves operate around 40 ~ 50 millisecs (0.04 second). However, the time takes to either pressurize or relieve the pressure from the chambers before transferring motion to the valve is not as fast as solenoid. Even it is 0.2 ~ 0.3 seconds, it is adding to 0.5 seconds gear shift interrupt and in total comes to 0.8 sec. Add all variations in real world scenario, you might be perceiving the response delay of 1.0 sec or more particularly when you are accelerating. Usually, for these kind of technologies, accumulation of ECU signals, responses and final actuation is not perceptible in steady state driving. However, when you really need the engine to respond fast, the LOGIC plays major role in switching from one mode to the other. Probably comparable to ""Gear Hunting"" in AutoShift of Maruti Celerio.

Even then, this technology applied only to FCA so far but successful in gasoline dominated markets such as USA. It is my belief based on experiences that the software & host of other conditions might not have tuned for India as it calls for greater investment, long cycle development, calibration & implementation and not to mention the sad state of India specific product engineering at FCA which is non-exist!

Thanks for clarifying. VANOS & MultiAir are different from a functional perspective. MultiAir & BMW Valvetronic are apple to apple. MultiAir also has a functionality for phasing (timing change) but in a very constrained manner. It can't match VANOS, moreover, MultiAir is only for Intake and not for exhaust where as VANOS is for both Intake & Exhaust.

With paddle shifters, you don't have to take your hand off the steering wheel. Plus, it's more or less expected in premium cars (even the cheaper Civic had it way back in 2006!).

Any update on this? Look's like the diesel AT is permanently delayed.
The last I read, the delay was being attributed to high demand of the manual variant but that is true even for the Nexon but Tata's are moving full steam ahead with the AMT.",,,,,,,

Also but OT but there should be some kind of PIL against ARAI for giving some real insane and unrealistic milage figures for most cars.

Well there is a lag below 1800 rpm, but in city that will not make a difference as in any case you are supposed to go slow and steady within city. On highways you are almost always above 1800 rpm. There is nothing that cannot be solved by a bit of heavy foot if you need any more punch. It is seriously enjoyable to drive if you drive the way it is meant to. And that you will learn in due course of ownership. As advised, buy the max 5 years warranty pack and take engine cover for sure in insurance.

Maintenance/Service cost is normal because the interval is 15000 km/1 year not like others which has 6 monthly intervals. So the amount might look high in the bill however that needs to be compared with 2X bill of other manufacturers. Rest when you own a premium brand you should expect a premium in service charge as well.",,,,,,,

Well it all depends on your driving. If you know how to caress the beast it will reward with decent figures or it will sip.
I drive in Delhi NCR which has good amount of bad traffic

I am getting on an average of 9 kmpl ( 25% highway, 75% city ) with mix of very sedate and very mad driving. Lately i have controlled myself and avoid full throttle and am getting 10 kmpl ( attachment ) for the past 745 kms. But even in these 745 kms , I have pushed the beast ( floored to metal) lot of times. On a very congested stretch i get around 7 - 8 kmpl, and on Highways 12-14.

I think you can push a bit more for the Jeep Longitude. They should do something in Insurance,as that is what they did for me. Nothing else.",,,,,,,

I think almost all cars in that segment apart from the Innova which anyways isn't in the same group of vehicles, have a 1 year service interval. The km range may be lesser (10k km is standard I guess) but then most people considering buying a petrol SUV would not be doing more than that in a year.",,,,,,,

And i think this is a minimum you should get.
Yes most of the modern manufacturers nowadays give 1 year and 10000 km intervals. But a difference of 5k on a year is a good difference. Even 40 km per day would cross the interval in 8 months and if you do any outstation this will be even quicker. That is my worry.",,,,,,,

1. I own one and the fondness is increasing with every passing day. Petrol AT is a good choice for city drive and excellent for highway drives. It has all the positives of Jeep Compass ( read built quality, dynamics, Steering, safety pack, bold look) and add a convenience of automatic. The only gripes in owning this variant for few would be fuel efficiency ( ~ 9 kmpl in city, 12 on highway, turbo lag below 2000 rpm and may be rear seat space if you plan to travel with 5 full grown adults regularly). For rest, as you said ""After driving Jeep, you forget rest in competition"".

2. Black color will be difficult to maintain, no doubt but JC in black is absolutely sexy. Will recommend PPF over 5 panels and ceramic coat over the car. That should do. I got mine and am really loving it.

3. I think the discount looks good, and you will see a price hike once BSVI kicks in. Jeep is notorious in not giving lots of discounts generally.

4. For Petrol variants, I don't think it would be any major difference if you wait for BSVI. On hind sight, expect price increase and removal of any discount scheme.

Cheers",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,Jeep Compass,,"Well Sir, Diesel auto ( updated transmission as per AutocarIndia) is coming soon. Please also pardon me for this long post, as I have been reading a lot of false comments about media calling JC Petrol auto as a bad car to drive.

Now to your second question around lethargy of Petrol Auto. I would like to see ""one"" article anywhere which says it is lethargic. What I have read is that it is not as effortless as its diesel sibling, and given a choice diesel engine experience is superior. In fact every one says it is a fast car. Even our team bhp review says the same.

Let's rewind ourselves.

From team bhp :

What you'll like:

• Handsome Cherokee-inspired styling & loads of character
• Solid build. Feels very robust, just as a Jeep should
• 1.4L turbo-petrol makes 161 BHP! Offers fast performance
• Smooth 7-speed dual-clutch Automatic
• Mature suspension setup, nicely-tuned EPS & rock-solid stability
• City-friendly size & higher seating make the Compass AT incredibly easy to drive
• Structurally safe, all-wheel disc brakes and a whole host of electronic aids (including ESP)
• We think the Compass is well-priced for what it offers

What you won't:

• 1.4L Petrol motor simply isn't as impressive as the all-rounded 2.0L Diesel
• No sport mode, no paddle shifters and no cruise control for this AT
• Petrol AT is unavailable in the lower variants. No AWD or 6 Airbags like the Diesel either
• Complex dual-clutch ATs have usually been troublesome in India
• Small size for the price! Also, narrow cabin is suitable for 4 adults, not 5
• Tiny dealership network. After-sales quality & long-term reliability are unknown factors as well
• Turning radius of 5.65m is more than the Safari Storme's. Further, 17º approach angle is too low
• Missing goodies (blanks on the steering, auto-dimming IRVM, auto wipers & headlamps, lumbar adjustment, reclinable rear seats)

Now lethargy and ""fast"" does not gels well. JC petrol auto is even faster than JC diesel in 0-100 and has better kick down acceleration figures than almost any car below 25 lacs. So called ""fastest SUV"" in its class from Kia is just 0.4 second faster to 100. JC does in 10.2 seconds which is ""fast"" in every sense. Post 120 kmph, Kia has no chance to match JC. 40-100 in Kia GTX Petrol takes 10.33 sec ( source cardekho.com) whereas JC petrol auto is 7.3 sec. I would like to know the list of all cars faster than JC petrol in 40-100 sprint or for that matter even 40-150 sprint below 25 lacs.
40-100 is where all fun lies and practically this what we should look at when comparing real world acceleration. On pure facts, Kia cannot match JC petrol auto on open stretches. I am comparing JC with Kia's new car here as it claims to be the fastest car in its class.

These are all figures and may be in real life you would have felt lethargy in the car.

Even I felt that during my test drive, but it was only a matter of foot pressure that you must apply. You need to apply more pressure on this vehicle than most other cars, I would imagine. That's all the difference.

I am in no way claiming that this is the best car you can buy today within 25 lacs.

I agree that you feel engine is vocal and also sluggish below 2000 rpm, but the car makes up for this sluggishness after 2000 rpm. Practically, you should know how to tame the 161 horses !",,,,,,,

Petrol AT is a good choice if you can adjust to the turbo lag and somewhat slow gearbox response. I suggest to go for the Limited Option variant as you get the bi-xenon headlamps which should have been available in lower variants as well (might be difficult to fit later and will cost almost same, also warranty might be impacted)

@Roadster17 - I know you are a proud owner of the Compass Petrol auto and passionate about it. So, I understand your reaction. I am just saying the petrol auto is not so easy to recommend like the diesel for a driver-oriented SUV/crossover in this price range as the performance is not so great (also, no sports mode, no paddle shifts, no cruise control ). I will stop my rant here but quoting GTO's comments from the petrol AT review thread, as it summarizes my opinion as well -
""While the Compass diesel is my pick of the segment, it's not the case with the petrol DDCT. I found this engine + gearbox combination to be very 'meh'. In the Compass diesel, that lovely 2.0L brings a lot of driving pleasure; the petrol AT isn't a patch on it. If I was looking at a Petrol AT crossover, I'd spend a little more and get the Tucson, or save big bucks and be happy with the Creta. Somehow, the Compass Petrol AT just didn't pull at the heartstrings as the Diesel did. For all the tech that this DDCT has, it's merely average. I know some torque-converter ATs that are superior.""

Buddy, it's not about autobahn, it's about everyday driving experience. In fact, the Compass Petrol AT does pretty well in flat out acceleration. It is during normal driving conditions where the turbo lag and relatively slower gearbox can get frustrating. If it works for you, please buy one and enjoy the car.

As I said, Jeep should come out with a reasonably priced Diesel Auto soon if it wants to regain the lost momentum.
Peace.

As the cities ( and highways) get clogged, how your car responds to quickly close the gaps or helps overtaking without creating anxiety becomes very important. Importance of decent performance is not limited to the tracks or autobahns but even in the daily commutes. Bringing those numbers just makes the discussion more 'objective'. Difference of 1 or 2 seconds in the 20-80 acceleration can be felt while negotiating the traffic. But I agree that 'stopping' power is equally (or more) important and the magazines should start highlighting them more.",,,,,,,

Buddy, that is even what I was referring to. There were lots of comment on the performance of JC Petrol auto as lethargic reported by media/ reviewers and is used by many fellow bhpians on different forum. I was trying to make a point that it is a fast car even if compared on numbers/data alone. Do not agree with the label as ""lethargic"" and have not found any article till date which says so.

Auto magazines do publish 100-0 and 80-0 figures as well.

I absolutely agree that overall as a package ( good looks, rock solid build quality, convenience of petrol AT and all necessary features) JC is a good alternative. However preference is always personal so there will be differences in opinion too.

Lastly, I do not endorse anything illegal on road. Drive safe ! However do not forget to enjoy the vehicle as well.",,,,,,,

__________________
It's ok to discuss, right ? That's is the real objective of the forum.

Coming back to GTO's review - I have lot of admiration and respect for GTO.

His comments are on Petrol AT when compared to Diesel. Majority of people will have the same opinion if comparing both. However a car is much more than performance. GTO suggested Creta and Tucson which do not pulls my heart string.

There is another post from him :

""The Compass Petrol AT isn't underpowered at all! In fact, it's a fast SUV. What takes away from the driving experience is the lag & dimwitted gearbox.""

So, as a stand alone product it is not a slow and lethargic vehicle as per him as well.

Even, I have shared this that there is a lag below 2000 rpm and there is no gearbox performing as well as DSG in Indian market. So, there can be a situation when you will feel that gearbox is not supporting you. But that's rare and happens in almost all gearbox. Maybe, they did something on gearbox in 2019 manufactured vehicle.

As far as passion goes, I am passionate about Octavia as well which I don't own.",,,,,,,

Agree that the difference of accelerating can be felt- I know it from personal experience of using the City CVT BUT..it’s also a question of putting ourselves in a situation that requires those split second overtaking manoeuvres. How many such occasions are completely unavoidable? Perhaps not more than once or twice in a span of many driving hours/ trips. The rest is just our desire to experience and perhaps show off the capabilities of the car at our disposal. And as others have said, the larger point is that the performance available is more than adequate on a normal basis. Does it justify its price? Perhaps yes, more so than say, an over priced Creta.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,Jeep Compass,,"I'm in a Market for a mid-size SUV, evaluated Compass today. Took test drive of Diesel and Petrol AT. While I like Diesel, Petrol AT was disappointed. I was also looking forward to TD Petrol Manual but the TD vehicle was not available with Dealer.

Petrol AT has quite a lot of lag and I have the feeling that MT will be better to drive with that 1.4 L Petrol turbo engine.

Has anyone owned or driven Petrol MT? Please share feedback. Thanks

Team-BHP,Jeep Compass,,"With all the ridiculous rains that have been happening in Pune this year, am seriously considering changing my Polo GT TSI for a bigger car in time for next years monsoon.

Heart says Compass, head says EcoSport or similar but that discussion is for another day.

My mileage is super low (I've only clocked 2500km on my polo in a year and a half) so looking at the Compass Petrol AT. My budget can not go anywhere near a new one, so looking at a second hand one with low mileage.

Have found a 2017 1.4 AT Limited Option with 15k on the clock. What would be a reasonable price for this in Pune? Anything particular to look out for? Does Jeep do a vehicle check that I could get? Does the Limited Option come with Android Auto / CarPlay?

Would appreciate some help on these points if possible. Many thanks.",,,,,,,

Now I need your help to resolve following 3 question.
1. Is petrol AT is good choice ?
2. How difficult to maintain Black color.
3. Is the deal with this discount is fine .
4. Should I go ahead or wait for 3 months for 2020, BS VI model.

Thanks in advance for you support.
I have a black limited compass petrol and I absolutely love it despite motor enthusiast's negative sentiments towards it.
She celebrated her 2nd b'day this November and not a single issue yet. Recently did a 1100 kms stretch from Ranchi to Madhepur via Patna and back. The roads are not the best in the stretch and there were several huge potholes but driving the Jeep was an absolute pain-free experience.
The average was around 12 kmpl at the end of the trip.
I wash-wax it weekly and the shine is as good as new but mind you, slight dust takes a lot away from this striking black beauty
Here is a recent pic...cant take my eyes off her!",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,Jeep Compass,,"Hi Everyone
Almost, closing the deal for Jeep Compass Limited Plus AT (Petrol).
Few queries and apprehensions before closing the deal. Basically i am in Mumbai, so obviously the car will be registered in Mumbai.
Presently, Struck with two dealers. One from Mumbai and another from Pune. Offer difference is quite huge. Dealer from Pune offering much better deal (40K difference).
He (Pune dealer) has ensured the passing/registration in Mumbai.
So, the issues are as follows:
1) Any particular thing i should discuss or get it cleared if going with Pune dealer?
2) should i go for extended warranty or it is part of the Jeep.
3) what are the servicing option in Mumbai and will it create any sort of issue if purchased from Mumbai?
4) Broadly how much servicing costs?
5) Should i go for ceramic paint protection, if so how much it costs approximately?
6) Finally, as i understood, first year insurance is zero dep and then 2 and 3 year third party. So, how much generally for zero dep for the second and third year?

thank you and regards

Can you present this to the Mumbai dealer and ask to match the deal? Are you able to see where the difference is coming from in cost? Is it the vehicle cost itself (Highly unlike) or higher taxes in Mumbai?

Yes. No seconds thought with regard to this, especially when buying a FCA vehicle. In general, it is better to lap up as much extended warranty as you can. Will save you a lot of money later on, in the event something were to go wrong. Make sure the extended warranty is offered by Mopar.

I cannot comment to this. You mean hassles if you bought the vehicle from Pune and having it serviced in Bombay? I do not see this to be an issue as long as FCA has a service outlet in Bombay.

Yearly service should set you back around Rs. 10,000 - 12,000. I would wait for some of the other Jeep owners to comment on this though.

Not from the dealer. Find a good independent car detail shop in your area to do this. Also check if the coating can handle regular washing of the car. If not, you might as well get a polish job done every 6 months or so and dry dust it as much as you can. Difficult to do in rainy weather.

You can do zero depreciation up to 3 years, on yearly renewal.",,,,,,,

Thank you so very much for clearing all my doubts.
Finally, the Mumbai dealer could match the discount to some extent. As the dealer is about 5 minutes away from my house, I thought it would be convenient to go with him. So, finally, I booked the Limited Plus Petrol Automatic and off course the Exotic red colour.

Felt slight lag. Probably, I was little cautious in traffic and not accelerating much. Any way the 18 inch alloy wheel looks grand.",,,,,,,

Subrat, I wouldn't suggest laminating the carpet floor. I had laminated the floor on my Punto in 2011 and I've now decided that my next car will not have laminated carpets. The seats have to be removed off the car for the procedure and we have to be wary of the squeaks/rattles in the worst-case scenario of an incompetent job done.

You can rather source good 3D mats and regular vacuuming of the floor will keep your car in good shape.",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"The MG Hector is on sale in India at a price of between Rs. 12.48 - 17.28 lakhs (ex-showroom, Delhi).

What you'll like:

• Big size & lots of bling for the money! We find the Hector to be well-priced
• A spacious cabin that can easily seat 5 adults. Massive 587 litre boot too
• Fiat-sourced 2.0L diesel is simply fantastic
• Compliant ride quality. Suspension is tuned for comfort
• Lots of kit (panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera, electric seats & tailgate etc.)
• ‘Connected’ Tablet ICE with an embedded SIM & lovely sound quality
• 5-year / unlimited km warranty with roadside assistance
• Top safety equipment includes 6 airbags, ESP, HSA, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS & more

What you won't:

• Awkward styling on the side & rear profiles. Looks weird from some angles
• Sloppy high-speed handling, noticeable body roll & easy understeer
• The petrol engine is “adequate” at best. Its guzzling Automatic variant is unimpressive
• No Diesel AT (Creta, Seltos, XUV500, Hexa offer this combination, which we love)
• Some annoyances like the ~6 meter turning radius, no auto-dimming IRVM, strange rpm meter…
• Small after-sales network. Service quality & long-term reliability are big unknowns
• Waiting period runs into a couple of months
• Don’t get blinded by the British branding. This is a Chinese car

SAIC - China's largest car maker - has had a relationship with the Indian car scene since many years now, albeit as a partner in GM India. GM left & SAIC wanted to enter independently, but it knew that an unknown Chinese brand selling awkwardly-named cars will have few takers in a crowded, maturing market. Solution = Acquire a British marque, hire a British brand ambassador, rename your cars and underplay the ""Chinese"" origin. It has proven to be quite a successful strategy. Few people on the street know that MG Motors is actually selling Chinese cars.

MG or Morris Garages, picked up the General Motors plant in Halol after the American carmaker shut down its India operations. The company has invested Rs. 2,000 crores in the 178-acre facility.

The Hector is the company's first product offering in India. It is nothing but a rebadged version of the Baojun 530 SUV. Unveiled at the 2017 Auto Guangzhou show in China, the SUV is a good case study for badge-engineering. It is sold as the Baojun 530 in China, Wuling Almaz in Indonesia, Chevrolet Captiva in South America and the MG Hector in India. While it is sold in both 5 and 7-seater variants in other markets, India gets only the 5-seat version for now.

It’s no wonder that MG's first car for India is a premium SUV. The Rs. 15-20 lakh SUV segment accounts for healthy volumes as well as fat margins for carmakers. Customers are also receptive to new brands (case in point, the Duster, Seltos & Hector). By the look of things, the Hector seems to have gotten off to a good start. In July, the company had to halt taking bookings due to production constraints. The company claimed to have received more than 21,000 bookings then. The bookings re-opened recently & MG claims to have received another 8,000 bookings.

The Hector sure attracts a lot of attention. It generated loads of interest whenever we stopped at hotels, parking lots, shooting locations, etc. Wherever we went, it turned heads. What MG lacks in terms of product engineering, it has tried to make up with bling & features. The flashy styling, big size, internet connectivity, large tablet-like ICE, panoramic roof, powered tailgate etc. have aroused a lot of interest.

The Hector measures 4,655 mm in length, 1,835 mm in width and 1,760 mm in height. It has a wheelbase of 2,750 mm and a kerb weight of 1,539 kg for the petrol version / 1,618 kg for the diesel. It is the longest car in its class & has the longest wheelbase as well. On the flip side, it's also heavier than all competitors, save for the Harrier.

The Hector's build is satisfactory and there is barely any flex in the sheet metal. The doors have a good deal of weight to them and the bonnet feels heavy to lift too. The paint job is very nice. However, the panel gaps are inconsistent in some areas. The gaps were uneven on either side of the bonnet of all our test cars. The tailgate too had larger-than-usual gaps, but thankfully, they were a little more consistent.



The Hector comes with a choice of 3 powertrains - a 1.5L, 4-cylinder turbocharged petrol, a 48V mild hybrid version of the former and a Fiat-sourced 2.0L, 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel. All engines are offered with a 6-speed manual transmission, while the 1.5L turbo petrol gets an optional 6-speed DCT. What sucks is that there is no diesel automatic on offer. Indians love their diesel AT SUVs, so we are a bit surprised by the omission. This is where brands like Hyundai & Kia score = they come all guns blazing with all engine + gearbox offerings (Creta & Kia, both, were launched with Diesel ATs).

Coming to safety, the Hector gets dual front airbags, ABS + EBD, ESP, traction control, hill hold, rear disc brakes, rear parking sensors, ISOFIX child seats mounts, 3-point seatbelts for all occupants, seatbelt reminders for the front seats, speed sensitive auto-door locking and speed alert warning. The top variant (Sharp) gets 6 airbags (front, side & curtain) and a 360-degree camera, while the one below the top (Smart) gets 4 airbags (front and side). A tyre pressure monitoring system is available on the top two variants. The i-Smart system (offered on the Smart and Sharp variants) features remote car locking and unlocking, geo fencing, real time location sharing and emergency calling.

MG Motor is offering a standard warranty of 5 years / unlimited km. This is one of the best standard warranties in India. Reason? To control / minimise customer fears of an unknown brand and a new product with unknown long-term reliability. There is no option to extend it further though (some brands offer 6 & 7 year options). MG Motor is further offering 24x7 roadside assistance and 5 free services (labour only).

Handsome front end gets a large black grille, which gives the Hector a wide and mature stance. The turn-indicators / DRLs are on top, while the headlamps are lower down on the bumper. Road presence is great. Drivers give way when they see the Hector in their rear view mirrors:


W-e-i-r-d looking rear! Gets a lot of elements - dual tone bumper, massive faux skid plate and a thick red trim connecting the tail-lights. Single exhaust gets a cut out on the left:


Side profile is extremely quirky as well (only the front gets a from us), with a strange design and awkward proportions. Black cladding hides the visual bulk of the car, while giving an impression of higher ground clearance. The SUV gets blackened B & C-pillars, a floating roof and a sharp cut on the rear window line. Chrome is liberally used on the door handles, bottom edges of the doors and on the window line. Wheel and tyre combination appears too small for the bulk above:


Compared to its peers, the Hector is the longest car and also has the longest wheelbase. This thing turns heads like nobody's business:


Rear 3-quarter is nowhere as appealing as the front 3-quarter view. More ""van"" than SUV from some angles:


Slim & smart LED DRLs sit just below the bonnet. Thick chrome inserts run under them:


DRLs double up as turn-indicators with a progressive action. Looks damn nice!


LED headlamps + LED foglamps are bunched together and placed lower on the bumper. These get a thick C-shaped chrome trim. The lights are sufficiently powerful and the fogs serve as cornering lamps as well. That said, many BHPians are rightfully concerned that even a small frontal impact will damage the headlamps due to their unconventional placement:


A look at all the lights in action:


DRLs are bright and prominent, even during the day. They serve as pilot lamps and dim a little when the headlights come on:


Wide grille gets a honeycomb mesh design pattern, a large chrome MG badge in the middle and a thick chrome insert on the side + bottom edges. The holes along the top and sides of the grille are blanked out. Notice the front camera just below the MG badge:


Dual-tone bumper incorporates a trapezoidal air dam & a honeycomb mesh grille with a silver surround that extends below as a faux skid plate. Lots of bling & flash here for mass market tastes:


Front bumper gets two parking sensors - one below each of the foglamps. Don't miss the subtle MG branding:


Towing point is located on the left side of the car & gets a plastic cap:


Fake skid plate ends rather abruptly and doesn't extend too far below the car. The Hector has a ground clearance (laden) of 180 mm:


Some underbody protection has been provided for the crucial parts:


Long bonnet is largely flat and slightly raised in the middle, with a vertical crease. Prominent creases are given at the corners for effect:


Wiper spindles are tucked away under the bonnet...


...as are the windshield washers. We hate it when manufacturers place these on top of the bonnet:


Both windshield washers squirt out effective sprays (rather than jets) of water. The wipers have a good sweep:


Shut lines on the doors are consistent...


...but those around the bonnet are not. All our test cars had varying panel gaps here:




Take a look at the wide shut lines on the tailgate:


Dual-tone ORVMs with integrated blinkers:


They get a camera underneath (part of the 360 view system):


Door handles get classy chrome inserts. Driver + front passenger doors (both) get a request sensor:


Only the driver's side gets a keyhole. Insert the key in this slot to pry open the cover and access the keyhole:


Glass area is large. However, the extreme rear openings are small. The B, C and D-pillars are blacked out giving the roof a floating effect. Notice how the window line rises at the rear after the C-pillar:


Glossy black plastic inserts protrude out on either side of the rear windshield:


Square wheel arches are prominent & get black plastic cladding running around them:


The Hector's wheel-tyre combination looks too small for the wheel arches and all the sheet metal above. Would say that the wheel size is perfect, but the tyre sidewall should have been taller. 17-inch dual tone machined alloys shod with 215/60 section Continental Contact MC5 tyres. The Harrier gets beefier 235/65 R17 rubber:


Character lines run across the sides. Doors get black plastic cladding with a thick chrome strip on them. Notice the sharp kinks on the doors:


""Morris Garages"" is embossed on the chrome strip of the doors, just in case you forgot the British relationship (there is no prominent SAIC or Chinese badging visible anywhere). You can't see the car's running board because the doors overlap it:


Front tyres get aero flaps ahead of them:


Hector gets rear disc brakes - a welcome feature. The Seltos & XUV500 are the only other SUVs in the price bracket to offer the same:


Roof is dominated by a large panoramic sunroof. Owners will love it:


Silver roof rails can be used to mount roof racks or other carriers. Mounting points are provided:


Body-coloured sharkfin antenna sits towards the end of the roof section:


Tailgate gets a neatly integrated spoiler:


Windshield washer is neatly integrated in the HMSL (on the right):


All-LED tail-light clusters house a slim horizontal indicator at the top, a long rectangular pilot lamp and a slim brake lamp set in it:


With all the lights in action. They look fantastic at night! If you want flash, the Hector is your car


The number plate gets a recessed housing. Red garish strip runs on top of it, connecting the tail-light clusters. No, it doesn't light up. Chrome is used on the badges, for a couple of strips on either side of the MG logo and above the number plate housing. There are no engine or variant badges anywhere:


Rear wiper is of a decent size and very usable during the rains. Unlike some cars where the sweep area is small, it's more than adequate here:


Hector badge on the left (ignore the BU Bhandari dealer sticker below)...


...and a cheesy Internet Inside badge on the right. Yuck. Reminds me of those ""Intel Inside"" stickers! We would debadge this from the showroom itself:


Rear bumper has a large black insert and a silver faux skid plate. A slim red reflector strip runs across the bumper, while four parking sensors are provided. The rear is overdone IMHO:


Reverse camera is tucked away beside the electronic boot release. The Hector gets a powered tailgate, which makes opening and closing it a breeze. Number plate illuminators are white LED units:


Rear foglamps and the reversing lights are tucked away at the bottom-corners. Reversing lights are bright and provide good illumination:


A look at the rear fog and reversing lights in action:


Trapezoidal exhaust tip gets a cut out in the skid plate. MG added a dash of chrome here too!!


Semi-independent helical spring torsion beam suspension at the back. The spare is a full size tyre mounted on a steel rim:


With the king-of-the-segment. The Hector appears a full size bigger than the Creta:",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Interior - Front



The front doors of the Hector open and close with a triple-stage action. They have a good amount of weight to them. While there isn't a very satisfying thud when you shut them, they still feel robust. The doors open wide enough and the running board is not too broad, especially for an SUV of this size. The floor is at a decent height, while the roof is on the higher side. Getting in and out is easy.

On the inside, the Hector offers ample legroom and headroom for the front occupants. The roof does slope down a bit from the B-pillar towards the rear, but it doesn't affect the headroom & the rear windshield is of an acceptable size. The big side windows and sunroof let in a lot of light into the car.

When you step in for the first time, the tablet-ICE & panoramic sunroof do add to the ""wow"" factor and we're certain, it closed a lot of sales. The dashboard is black with silver highlights and dominated by that large 10.4-inch touchscreen head-unit. It looks contemporary and while an all-black scheme can make the interiors too dark for the occupants, the roof and pillars are grey, which help matters. The doorpads, seats, carpets and floor mats are black as well and will conceal any signs of soiling.

The plastics on the dashboard are soft touch and the front portion is covered in leather with white stitching. The quality is better than we had expected and it feels at par with other cars at this price point. Yes, there are some hard plastics used, but they are well finished with no rough edges to be found. The seat upholstery gets faux leather with contrast white stitching. The same leather is also used on the doorpads, gear lever and steering wheel. In terms of ergonomics, the cabin is well laid out, except for the wide-spaced pedals (more on that later). All controls are within reach.

The quality and feel of the buttons and switches is satisfactory. They appear to be built to last. That said, there are not a whole lot of buttons thanks to the portrait-oriented touchscreen on the dashboard. We sure wish the air-con got dedicated physical knobs.

MG Motor has added features like auto headlamps and wipers, electric seat adjustment, an Infinity surround sound system, connected car technology called i-Smart and a panoramic electric sunroof.

Dashboard is well-screwed together and nicely finished. One can't find any rough edges anywhere:


Cowl on top of the instrument cluster looks good. It gets leather with contrast stitching:


Nice and high driving position. Windshield is large and offers a good view of the road ahead. Some will appreciate that they can view the bonnet while driving:


A-pillars are not excessively thick and do not cause major blind spots. Lateral view and all-round visibility are satisfactory:


3-spoke, flat bottom leather-wrapped steering wheel gets a silver insert and thumb contours. It is just the right size and has just the right thickness! Steering feels great to hold and offers satisfactory grip. It looks and feels very premium. The steering-mounted control buttons are one size too small, but they are well laid out and so, easy to operate. That said, I feel there are too many buttons on the wheel and it looks extremely cluttered! Further, the hornpad isn't easy to reach for those with shorter thumbs and it is a little firm to press:


Left spoke houses the MID navigation and cruise control buttons. The right spoke houses the infotainment system, telephony and voice command buttons. The call disconnect button doubles up as a mute button:


A close look at the perforated leather and stitching pattern on the steering wheel:


Steering adjustment lever is smooth to operate and doesn't have too much weight either:


Steering gets both tilt and telescopic adjustment. GTO, however, wished the steering tilt adjustment went a little lower:


Start / stop button gets a silver ring around it. A red light glows if you press the engine start/stop button without pressing the clutch (""ignition on"" mode):


The light turns green when the engine is running:


Except for the needles, the instrument cluster is all black when you get into the car. Looks very wicked!


Turn on the car and the needles do a clean sweep. I think we've had enough of this gimmick though and manufacturers should stop it now:


Speedo on the left and the tacho on the right with a 7-inch MID in the middle. It is well laid out, but visibility suffers during the daytime. The rpm meter is a disaster - it runs counterclockwise! Differentiation just for the sake of it, killing usability & against common sense. Both the petrol and diesel get the same tacho marked till 8,000 rpm (surprising lack of attention to detail in a premium car). Dials are difficult to read in a glance on the move. The markings simply aren't prominent enough - they are too dim. The Hector gets digital fuel and temperature gauges at the top, while it displays the selected gear, odo and distance to empty counter at the bottom of the MID:


Toggle up/down and you will see the MID showing current speed and instantaneous FE, current driving time and range, 1st trip meter & average fuel consumption and 2nd trip meter & the average speed:


Pressing the top left button on the LHS of the steering wheel will display the TPMS, media, phone, navigation with turn by turn directions, backlight illumination level and warnings (including overspeeding and fatigue). The MID also shows the exact door that is open:


Chunky stalks are of good quality. Left stalk controls the front / rear wipers and the rear foglamp, while the right one controls the headlamps and foglamps. Automatic headlights work as expected, but the auto wipers are very finicky at times. They are unpredictable in the rains - we switched to manually operating the wipers several times. Tap the light stalk once to activate the lane change indicator:


Air-con vents get a C-shaped silver surround and a chrome insert in the air flow direction controller. The air flow can be shut (almost) by rolling the volume controller wheel downwards:


Switches for the MID illumination, headlamp leveller, ORVMs and boot release are located below. These are nice & tactile to use:


A small cubby hole to store toll receipts / coins. It has a prominent lip, which ensures the contents won't fall out:


Fuel flap release and bonnet release levers are located further down on the dashboard. Notice how the bonnet release is wider, so you don't need to look at them while opening them:


Doorpads get a similar theme as the dashboard - all-black with silver inserts. This will ensure they do not get soiled easily. They are well finished and there are no sharp edges. The armrest is covered in leather:


Metal-finished door handles are standard on all variants of the Hector. They feel sturdy & look fabulous:


Silver handle to pull the door shut feels premium. While the plastics are all hard, the armrest is padded and covered in leather. White stitching looks cool:


Power window switches get silver inserts and a piano black console. The driver's window gets auto up/down with anti-pinch functionality. All of these are illuminated:


Door pockets can easily accommodate water bottles + other knick-knacks:


Front seats are upholstered in leather and comfortable, even for larger drivers. The seats are firm and the headrests are soft. Under thigh support is adequate. Despite missing out on adjustable lumbar support, the seats offer good support on long drives:


Sharp variant gets powered seats for the driver and front passenger (6-way adjustments for the driver and 4-way adjustments for the passenger). The hybrid version gets a battery below the passenger seat and misses out on the powered front passenger seat:


Fore & aft travel range is enough to accommodate tall & short drivers alike:


Height adjustment range is healthy as well. Short or tall, no one will complain:


A look at the seat pattern. The side bolsters are supportive:


Center armrest has soft leather cladding. MG has given the Hector so many features that they should have given it a sliding armrest too! Current one is alright for our 5'10"" driving positions, but shorter drivers might find it to be too behind:


Front seatbelts are adjustable for height. They get pretensioners and load limiters:


Check out the MASSIVE gap between the clutch & brake pedals! Awfully strange. You could even fit your XL-sized shoe in between:


My whole foot can easily slide between the pedals. This also causes the clutch pedal to be placed too close to the dead pedal:


Dead pedal is a piece of rubber stuck on the floor. While its angle is perfect, it's not very wide:


Folks with wide feet will find the dead pedal completely useless. I use size 10 shoes and my foot kept brushing with the clutch every time I kept it on the dead pedal. In fact, I preferred to keep my left leg on the floor instead!


ORVMs are sufficiently wide and tall. They give a good view of the action behind. That said, for an SUV of this size, I would have liked the mirrors to be a size bigger. The housing is large enough, but the glass area could have been bigger:


IRVM covers the entire rear windscreen:


Sadly, the IRVM only gets manual day/night adjustment. It is quite shocking in a car that is otherwise so well equipped. Uniquely, there is a USB power port for your dashcam. Pretty nifty! It powers up only when the ignition is in the ""ON"" position. So, no worries of draining the battery:


Like most large SUVs, the rearward view is strictly average. The small windscreen and thick D-pillars restrict visibility. While the side windows help matters, it's best to use the reversing camera and parking sensors:


Center fascia is slightly tilted towards the driver and houses a vertically-oriented touchscreen head-unit:


C-shaped silver inserts are present on the outer edges of the vents. They look awesome! The 10.4-inch touchscreen gets a piano black border. It's covered in detail in a separate post:


Physical buttons have been provided for the volume, defogger and screen on / off. AC controls are touch based and you need to take your eyes off the road if you want to adjust them on the move. Of course, you can use voice commands for the climate control too & it works rather well (although we still insist that physical controls should have been provided - for ease of use & in case the touchscreen packs up):


Weirdly, the ESP off button is on the passenger side of the touchscreen. Hazard light button is on the driver's side:


Air-con controls get permanent shortcuts at the base of the touchscreen. The Hector comes with a single zone climate control, 8-level fan speed adjustment and a temperature range from 17 to 32 centigrade before hitting LO and HI respectively. The fan is silent at levels 1 & 2, audible at 3 & 4, loud at 5 and very loud at levels 6 and 7. Cooling performance is fantastic, although we didn't get a chance to test it in summer. So, we will rely on owners' feedback for the system's real world performance. One downside I found was getting the driver's side center AC vent aligned perfectly. It took a lot of trial and error. Also, it threw more air than expected at lower blower speeds:


1 AUX & 2 USB ports with a plastic cover are located at the base of the center fascia. The left hand side USB port can be used for charging devices, while the one on the right can be used to connect your smartphone to the infotainment system. The cover is robust enough:


360-degree view and parking sensor on/off buttons are located just behind the gear lever:


Two cup-holders are located to the left of the handbrake. There should have been a storage cubicle in front of the gear lever. With 2 coffee cups, I'm not sure where to keep the phone:


Center armrest has a deep but narrow storage compartment underneath. Thanks to the handbrake lever, the base has 2 different heights. The square portion gets a rubber mat:


12V charging port with a plastic cover has been provided inside. The cover makes it difficult to put a longer-than-average-sized plug. A close-up to show how much space the cover takes up when open:


Glove box is fairly accommodating. Owner’s manual placed here for reference:


A cooling vent has been provided:


Roof bezel consists of individual map lights, sunroof controls and a sunglass holder. All cabin lights go out with a theatre-dimming effect. Even if the cabin lights are left in the ""ON position"", they will go off when you lock the car from outside (to prevent battery drain). The Bluetooth mic is located behind the perforated bit on the right, while the sunglass holder gets a silver insert. The 2 buttons on the top left / right are for the sunroof's electric sunshade


Sunglass holder has a soft opening action and a protective lining on the inside to prevent your sunglasses from getting scratched:


Sunvisors are well built and feel solid. Driver's side unit gets a ticket holder and a vanity mirror with a cover + illumination:


Passenger's side unit too gets an illuminated vanity mirror:


Dual airbags are standard on the Hector. Apart from these, the Smart variant gets...


... side airbags to make it a total of 4 (no seat covers here please):


Top-end Sharp variant adds curtain airbags as well (6 in total):


Massive panoramic sunroof is just wow! It gets an electric shade. By default, the shade opens till the halfway mark, unless you keep pressing the sunshade button:


The sunroof spans the length of the cabin and lets in a lot of light, even when shut. Only the front half is openable:


A wind deflector pops up the moment the sunroof is opened:


The front portion slides over the rear (we don't like this about panoramic sunroofs - looks ugly from the outside). The opening is large:


Things are neat and tidy even in places where most owners won’t look. There are no loose wires or cables dangling anywhere. Here's a peek below the dashboard in the driver's footwell...

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Interior - Rear

The rear doors of the Hector open and close in a triple-stage action. They swing out sufficiently wide, and the high roof means that one does not have to bend down while getting in. The seat is also placed at a comfortable height which makes ingress & egress convenient, even for the elderly. In this pic, notice how long the doors are at the bottom - they cover up the car's (side) running board:


Gap between the seat and the B-pillar is sufficiently wide to make it easier to step in & out:


Door sill is not wide either + its level with the floor, which means passengers do not have to swing their feet a lot or lift them high while getting in / out of the car. Easy peasy:


Smart black doorpads follow the same theme as the front. There is a silver door handle, piano black inserts and a soft leather cladding + white stitching on the long armrest. Rear tweeters & speakers are housed in the doorpads:


The door pockets, while not as big as the front ones, are wide and can easily carry a 1L bottle and some other odd items:


The rear seat is wide enough to accommodate 3 adults. All the occupants get headrests + 3 point seatbelts. Both - the seatbase and seatback - have some contours to hold you in place:


Legroom is generous and two 6-footers can easily sit one behind the other in comfort. Thanks to the lack of a floor hump, even the middle occupant will be comfortable:


Seatbacks of the front seats are scooped out, which helps in freeing up some more knee room:


Cabin width is healthy, which means three adults can sit quite comfortably. Center passenger sits a little higher up due to the slightly elevated seatbase; he also sits a little more in the front because of the center armrest bulging out:


Seatbelt buckles are parked in dedicated cut-outs and have straps to hold them in place when not in use:


ISOFIX child seat anchors are available in all the variants of the Hector. They have been provided on both sides and are well hidden:


A look at the maximum and minimum legroom available:


With the front seat in Aditya's 5'10"" driving position, he has about 6"" of knee room to spare. With the front seat moved all the way back, he still has over 2"" of knee room!! The seatbacks of the front seats are soft & scooped out where the knees are placed:


The seatback can be reclined, so getting a comfortable angle is easy. The headrests are soft, adjustable & practical:


Left & right passengers can have their own individual recline levels:


The surface at the base of the front seats gets soft cladding. So, it won't hurt the shin area of your legs. There is enough room under the front seats to tuck your feet in:


The front passenger seat can be reclined a long way back. Remove the headrest and you have an almost flat surface for the rear seat passenger to put his legs on:


Chauffeured owners rejoice! This configuration gives an incredibly relaxed seating position:


The center armrest is positioned at a comfortable height:


It is wide & soft, and comes with two cupholders. Thanks to the design, you can also plonk your phone in here. The inconsistent shape (look at the outer unevenness) reminds us of after-market fitments though:


Overall glass area is adequate and there is enough light coming in. The cabin doesn't feel claustrophobic at all. While the lower half of the cabin is in dark colours, the upper half has a light shade. This helps matters. At this price point, we would have liked to see roll-up sunshades on the rear windows (Seltos has them):


Quarter glass between the C and D-pillars helps in letting more light into the cabin:


Rear window does not roll in entirely. In fact, it's not even close!


Two seatback pockets provided. They are adequately deep and wide:


Rear passengers get air-con vents with an air volume controller, and a smartphone holder at the base:


A USB fast-charging port with a plastic cover has been provided as well:


Storage space at the base of the console is fairly wide & deep. Here is a 4"" iPhone SE placed for reference:


Spring-loaded grab handles with coat / bag hooks:


Rear occupants get these LED lights on either side of the roof, behind the grab handles:


Absolutely no floor hump! Sliding into the middle seat is much easier and that passenger can place his feet comfortably on the floor:


Markings for the curtain airbags on the C-pillars:


Massive 587-liter boot opens wide, thanks to the tailgate-mounted lights. The loading lip isn't very high either:


Boot area has a fabric cover to keep prying eyes off your luggage:


To adjust to the reclining function of the seatbacks and the 40:60 seats, it is split in two parts and has some slack:


They are stuck to the rear seats using Velcro:


Removing the parcel tray makes the boot look bigger. The family's vacation luggage will easily fit in here:


Boot light is located on the right side:


For increasing cargo space, the rear seats can be folded down. To fold the seatbacks down, one has to use the same handle that is used for reclining:


Instead of the usual 60:40 split, it's a 40:60 here (related thread (How do you like the 60-40 rear seat split?))! The seatbase is fixed and cannot be tumbled forward, like in some SUVs:


Folding the seats down gives you massive cargo space - enough to move home!


Top tether for the child seat (there's one on each side of the rear seat):


Tailgate gets full cladding on the inside. No ugly bits sticking out anywhere:


A tailgate emergency opener has been provided at its base:


Simply press this button on the left and the tailgate will electrically close = no human effort. Nice to see all these luxury SUV features coming to the 15 - 20 lakh segment:


Sturdy handle on the right to pull the tailgate down manually:


Pull this strap to lift the boot floor:


Underside of the boot floor gets a nifty string + hook:


Using these, the boot floor can be hooked open:


Empty space can be used to hide away your laptop / cash / jewellery / valuables:


Left side houses the tools:

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"In-Car Entertainment

All variants, except for the base Style, get a 10.4"" capacitive touchscreen head-unit dubbed the 'i-Smart'. Connectivity is through Bluetooth, USB and AUX. Voice commands and Android Auto + Apple CarPlay are supported. MG has also provided built-in apps like TomTom navigation and Gaana music. Sound quality through the Infinity speakers is fantastic! There is some lag in the system though, and you'll frequently experience this while interacting with it.

Spend some time tuning the equalizer to your preferences and you'll experience top-class sound quality (for an OEM system). The bass punch is enough to make the IRVM vibrate, while the treble can get sharp (if you like it that way). Owners will love the audio quality. With such competent factory ICE systems, the after-market audio scene will vanish:


Sound is played through an Infinity branded speaker on each of the front doors...


...and the rear doors...


...Infinity branded tweeters on the front doors and...


...rear doors...


...along with a subwoofer in the boot:


The welcome screen shows the MG logo. It takes about 20 seconds to boot when starting afresh. Hidden trick = the system starts booting when you unlock the car, so as to minimize the startup time most owners will experience:


This is the home screen. In the top-left corner is the time, weather and network information. In the top-right corner is the name of the car and date. The middle portion displays the connected music, maps and FM radio shortcuts. Below these are the icons for i-Call, Settings and Files. In the bottom-left corner is the icon for the voice command with the air-con quick action and 360-degree camera icon next to it:


Brightness can be adjusted in 10 levels. Visibility suffers only in harsh + direct sunlight:


Other settings include options to roll down the windows and open the sunroof with the keyfob (press and hold unlock button):


Door unlocking (when you unlock the car) can be selected for just the driver's door or all doors. Auto unlocking (when the engine is turned off) can be selected as well. This feature is off by default:


If you want to find your car in a parking lot, you can press the lock / unlock button on the keyfob and the car's lights flash + horn blows (if selected):


Worried about the tailgate scrapping the ceiling or wall? It can be adjusted to open in 6 positions:


Settings for wiper maintenance and auto fold ORVM can be adjusted from this screen. Wiper maintenance will keep the wipers in the vertical position so that you can change the blades or clean them:


Car name can be set with a maximum of 12 letters. The system will respond to a ""Hello (carname)"" command:


Ambient mood lighting can be set to be in a constant mode (one colour) or random mode (all colours randomly):


If you connect a USB flash drive, it will show up here. You can play music, videos and images from it:


The air-con controls. Lack of physical buttons bothers us, despite the voice commands working well. Additionally, once you have finished adjusting the air-con settings, the system doesn't go back to the screen you were at (say Music) automatically. You have to go back manually. That's yet another step you have to go through. God help you if the touchscreen malfunctions on a long summer road-trip!


i-Smart system can be updated over the air (OTA):


A user manual is displayed as well. Very handy:


Navigation is provided by TomTom. It includes live maps with traffic information:


If you are opening the maps for the first time, expect a 15-20 second delay. Did we mention that the system is laggy?


Note the electric vehicle station category in the maps. A hint of the future?

A night shot to show the display quality:


The front and rear views are fine, but the side views tend to get very dark with no external light sources. Since the display is top-class, we'll blame the camera units:


i-Smart Connectivity features

The MG Hector comes with an embedded Airtel eSIM for data connectivity. The i-Smart system gets features like remote air-con on/off, remote sunroof control, remote door lock/unlock, remote light flashing and honking, ""find my car"" and stolen vehicle tracking assistance. The i-Smart system has tied up with companies like AccuWeather (for real-time weather updates), Adobe, Nuance (voice assist system), SAP (DMS system), TomTom (maps), Unlimit (network provider), CISCO (IoT connectivity), Microsoft (for user data security) and Airtel for telecommunications.

One of the features is the E-Call. In case the car's airbags are deployed, a text message with the location of the car is sent to the Pulse Hub (MG call center). A call is then made to the head-unit automatically. In case of no response, the owners registered phone is called, followed by a call to the listed emergency contact. If there is no response or there is a need for assistance, emergency services are sent to help you out:


Using the My MG smartphone app, one can check the condition of the car. Any issues (if found) will be highlighted:


The find-my-car feature allows the owner to see the live location of his Hector:


A geo-fence can also be applied. In case the car leaves the perimeter, the owner will get an alert:

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Driving the 2.0L Diesel MT

2.0L diesel is shared with the Jeep Compass. Sadly, there is no Diesel Automatic option, a big miss by MG:


The Hector gets a 1,956 cc, 4-cylinder diesel engine with an electronically-controlled variable geometry turbocharger. This is the same Fiat engine that powers the Compass & Harrier. Here, it produces 168 BHP @ 3,750 rpm (3 horses lesser than the Jeep) and 350 Nm @ 1,750 - 2,500 rpm (same as the Jeep). The motor is built at Fiat-Tata’s Ranjangaon (MH) facility. Between the diesel & petrol Hectors, it is indisputably the diesel that's more impressive. This is a jewel of an engine!

The Hector's power and torque figures are respectable, although at 1,618 kilos, the car is heavier than most other 5-seater SUVs (only Harrier is heavier). Still, with a power-to-weight ratio of 104 BHP / ton and a torque-to-weight ratio of 216 Nm / ton, the Hector does better than other cars like the Creta, XUV500 and Harrier. As you can tell, the best part about this motor is indeed its 350 Nm of torque.

Transmission duties are carried out by a 6-speed manual gearbox, which sends power to the front wheels. An automatic gearbox isn't available at the moment. A competent AT mated to this engine could expand this car's appeal twice, thrice, maybe four times over!! It's an accepted fact now that Rs. 20-lakh customers love their slushboxes.

The diesel moves off the mark effortlessly. As is typical of big turbo-diesel engines, the 2.0's low end is superb & overall driveability is good. 2nd gear test over a speed-breaker? Easy as pie. Heck, it can even take off from a standstill in 2nd gear! You won't be using the gear shifter too much in the city and depending on the traffic density, you could use either 2nd or 3rd like an automatic. There is some lag below 1,500 rpm, but it’s not excessive at all; you can start pulling the engine from ~1,200 rpm itself.

On the open road, the Hector is quick and you can make fast progress. The mid-range is simply fantastic and gets very addictive. The engine comes into its stride once the needle crosses 2,000 rpm, with a nice spike of torque. You'll enjoy the punch & it pulls very nicely till ~4,000 rpm. The torque on tap means you don't have to shift down much to overtake. On the expressway too, light overtaking is taken care of in 6th gear itself. Push the engine and it will revv to ~5,000 rpm, but honestly, there is no point doing this. Not only does it get noisy beyond 3,500 rpm, but it also runs out of muscle past ~4,000 rpm or so. When you want to cruise, the diesel can be an able & relaxed mile muncher, thanks to that 6th gear. Another small touch which we appreciate = the 80 km/h and 120 km/h speed warning isn't that irritating. In fact, we'll say that the 120 kmph warning is pleasant & well chosen.

The clutch of our brand new test car was on the heavier side, but I won't call its travel range long. Still, the weight will bother you in traffic (and you'll miss the AT too). On the flip side, the gear shifter is smooth + sweet to operate. MG did a smart thing by taking the gearbox from Fiat.

The NVH levels of the Hector are top-class. The outside world is kept outside. Road & tyre noise are well-controlled, while wind noise is par for the course (not excessive).

Coming to fuel economy, the Hector diesel has an ARAI rating of 17.41 km/l. This motor is known to be acceptably efficient & owners should be satisfied here.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Driving the 1.5L Petrol AT

1.5L petrol is an easy fit in this engine bay:


The Hector petrol is powered by a 1,451cc, 4-cylinder turbocharged engine. It's called the LJO, and gets a timing chain drive, Mitsubishi single scroll turbocharger and variable valve timing. The petrol engine produces 141 BHP (@ 5,000 rpm) and 250 Nm (@ 2,400 rpm). Among the Hector's rivals, only the Jeep Compass develops more power, while the XUV500 petrol puts out more torque. This engine is paired to a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed dual clutch transmission (DCT).

With a kerb weight of 1,603 kg, the Hector Petrol AT is among the heavier cars in the segment. It has a power-to-weight ratio of 88 BHP / ton and a torque-to-weight ratio of 156 Nm / ton. In a nutshell, we can tell you that the Petrol AT's performance is just average; it is not a fast car. The petrol-DCT combo is offered in the top-spec Smart and Sharp variants of the Hector. It's cheaper than the Compass, but more expensive than the Creta and Seltos.

At idle, you can barely hear the engine and even on the move, the refinement is certainly impressive. It's a smooth driving experience. The Hector petrol DCT moves off from a standstill in a smooth manner. Due to the turbocharger coupled with the heavy kerb weight, driveability is average, but the power delivery feels sufficient, especially at city speeds. There is a slight initial lag though, as there is no torque converter & the turbo-charger takes time to spool. Once you're moving, light accelerator input is all you'll need to commute in the city. The turbo starts singing at 1,750 rpm, and the engine comes into its stride above ~2,000 rpm. With a light foot, the gearbox upshifts relatively early to maximise efficiency & refinement. However, it doesn’t downshift too often and you are likely to feel the turbo lag in certain situations, such as on an incline or if you need to close a gap in traffic quickly. While driving in bumper to bumper conditions, one can put the gearbox in 'D' and just lift the foot off the brake pedal. The Hector will crawl forward (at ~7 km/h) without any accelerator input. If you are looking for a calm & convenient commuter, the Hector will fit the bill. But the engine + gearbox combination are far from impressive. It's response time can get slow to respond (to kickdown), and the AT does get confused about which gear to engage at times. At best, we'll give this engine + AT combination a 6 / 10 rating (Mod Aditya says 5.5). Not the choice of enthusiasts, this one.

On the open road, you can best describe this engine's performance as adequate (we'd use the same term for the city). Throttle response is not sharp & it sure doesn't feel like a 141 BHP unit. If you want speed, you will have to work the engine hard. The mid-range (between 2,000 - 4,500 rpm) is the only area where the action is. Engine noise gets loud beyond that too. We'd suggest a calm driving style with this car instead, as the Hector AT is a good long distance cruiser. The petrol engine spins at 2,150 rpm and 2,600 rpm @ 100 / 120 km/h respectively.

The 6-speed DCT is quite smooth. If the car is driven with a light foot, you'll never even know that the gears are being changed. However, we found the transmission to be slow compared to other DCT units we have experienced. The transmission gets a Sport (S) mode, which can be selected by shifting the gear lever to the right side. S mode holds revvs longer than the regular D mode. For quick overtaking, especially on undivided highways, it's better to use S mode or Manual (M) mode.

To engage M mode, move the gear lever to the right, then up (upshift) or down (downshift). This mode is useful when you want to prepare the car for an overtaking maneuver. It can also be used when you desire engine braking (say, while descending a ghat). In this mode, the transmission's response time is average.

Coming to NVH levels, this 1.5L engine is very refined, especially at city speeds. While cruising on the highway, it doesn't disturb the car's occupants either. Only above 4,500 rpm does it get loud. At legal speeds, wind noise and road noise are acceptably controlled.

The Hector Petrol AT has an ARAI-certified fuel economy figure of 13.96 km/l. Owners are reporting single digit numbers while driving in the city. Big & heavy petrol AT SUVs have never been known for their fuel efficiency and we expect the Hector to be no different. If you are heavy on the throttle, it's going to guzzle even more. MG knows that the Petrol AT is a guzzler and has hence deployed a rather cheap trick = the MID FE counter starts at 13 kmpl .

The long-term durability of this gearbox is unknown. In India, no dual-clutch gearbox has had a good reputation - not Ford's DCT and definitely not VW's DSG.

MG Turbo branding is retained for the petrol as well:


When was the last time you saw the term ""gasoline"" written? China & USA use it over ""petrol"". The small hole below is possibly for the Ad-blue in the diesel (common stamping for petrol and diesel panels). Shockingly, it didn't have a rubber cap in our test car:


The flap however has the familiar petrol sticker for Indian pump attendants:


DCT gets an electronic parking brake and auto hold - no need to keep the brake pedal pressed when waiting in traffic or at a signal:


Pleasant-looking gear lever:


Silver unlock button is located on the side of the shifter:


Engaged gear position is backlit. You'll be surprised at how many cars skip this basic + useful feature (Ford deleted it from the Endeavour!):


The usual P-R-N-D signs. E / S denote the Economy (regular D) and Sport modes, while M is displayed in manual mode:


Gearshift indicator suggests upshifts when in M mode. This is unique - we've never seen it in an AT!


MID displays an automatic vehicle holding sign when the auto-hold function is initially enabled. An indicator appears inside the tachometer whenever the car is held in place. MID also tells you when the gear shifter is not in the P position & you try to turn off the engine. A confirmation is flashed on the MID when the electronic parking brake is activated:",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Driving the 1.5L Petrol MT

The Hector petrol (mild) hybrid is powered by a 1.5L turbo-engine producing 141 BHP (@ 5,000 rpm) and 250 Nm (@ 2,400 rpm). It gets a belt starter generator and a Li-ion battery, which is placed under the front passenger's seat (as we have seen in some Maruti's too). The petrol hybrid is offered only with a 6-speed manual transmission and available in all variants, except the base (Style) trim which gets a non-hybrid 1.5L.

The Hector petrol moves off the line smoothly. Low-end torque is average and you need to revv the engine to get the most out of it. The 1.5L petrol starts feeling comfortable above 2,000 rpm. Sure, it can pull even from lower rpms, but the progress is slower. There will be situations where you'll either need to downshift...or be patient instead. The power on tap is adequate though, and owners will appreciate its refined nature. On the open road, the 1.5L petrol needs to be kept on the boil if you want to make quick progress. Power delivery isn't effortless; the car feels quick, but not fast. While the engine revvs to just under 6,000 rpm, it starts losing steam near 5,500 rpm. Like the DCT, we would suggest a calm & sedate driving style for the MT too. In 6th gear, the car can cruise at 100 & 120 km/h @ 2,300 & 2,800 rpm respectively. Overall, we'll say that the 1.5L petrol does the job, but that's it. The diesel is, without doubt, the more impressive engine.

The clutch of our test car was neither light nor heavy – it was middle of the way in terms of weight and had an average travel length. The gearshift is smooth to operate though. In terms of NVH, the petrol does very well. The motor is silent, and it is only post 5,000 rpm that it gets loud.

The Hector gets a 48V hybrid system. This is not a proper hybrid like the one seen in say, the Toyota Camry. It is just a mild hybrid that employs a starter generator which replaces both, the conventional starter and alternator. MG claims a 12% increase in fuel efficiency and an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions. The Hector Hybrid also gets an idling start / stop system, which switches the engine off when the car comes to a standstill and neutral is engaged. When the clutch is depressed, the engine fires up again. However, it can get very irritating. Thankfully, there is a switch to disable the annoying feature. The conventional lead acid battery in the engine bay is used by the idling start / stop system.

Brake energy regeneration is also a part of the Hybrid system. When you apply the brakes, some of the kinetic energy generated (which is lost in conventional cars) is converted into electric energy and stored in the battery. The energy stored in the Li-ion battery is used by the engine for providing additional torque during acceleration.

You can see the status of the hybrid system on the MID screen:


Gearshift suggesting tool will be appreciated by newbies:


Li-ion battery is located under the front passenger seat:

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Ride & Handling

The Hector uses a McPherson strut suspension with a stabiliser bar at the front and a semi-independent helical spring torsion beam at the rear. Let's get one thing out of the way = it takes a long time to learn how to perfectly tune suspensions (see how long Hyundai took, before achieving neutral car behaviour). The Chinese have absolutely no skill in this area and have hence, gone for a ""comfort oriented"" suspension. This is also the easiest kind of tune. Forget the Europeans, even Mahindra & Tata are ahead of MG in the suspension area.

Low speed ride quality is comfortable, with small bumps being absorbed well. Even if you drive fast in the city (60-80 km/h), the Hector soaks bumps & potholes in competently. Owners will be happy with the compliant suspension. On the highway too, the cabin remains comfy due to the soft tune, and the Hector absorbs broken patches nicely. But no, it's not a mature setup at all. If you speed a little on undulating roads, the car feels rather wallowy (wallowy is a term you'll get very familiar with, as a Hector owner). You'll also see it roll & pitch over bad roads, like a body-on-frame SUV. Solution = shed speed and back off the accelerator pedal.

We wish the Hector came with taller tyre sidewalls. These short ones do let sharp + big potholes into the cabin. Taller tyres would be the simplest solution to further enhance the Hector's ride quality. The 17” wheels are the perfect size, but the tyres are too short & too thin. These are things that SAIC / MG will only learn with experience.

The Hector is not a handler by any means. It's more of a comfortable cruiser than a corner carver. Straight-line stability is satisfactory. Drive sedately on the twisties and you'll be okay. Start pushing like an enthusiast and you'll see that body roll is there; you feel its weight in fast corners. The front tyres squeal like a baby if pushed (understeer comes in easy). These 215 mm tyres are too thin IMHO & the suspension's damping / dynamic tuning are amateurish. A car like the Jeep Compass is in another league altogether and remains the enthusiast’s top choice. Forget the Compass, even a ""boring"" Creta will run rings around the Hector. Because some people were discussing this, let me clarify that the Hector isn’t dangerous and starts wailing well before you reach its limit (it’s not scary like a Safari or Scorpio). Best you drive it as a calm person. It's reassuring to know that all variants of the Hector get ESP (electronic stability program), traction control and hill hold.

The Hector has an easy-to-use steering. Its light in the city and while parking. The steering is light on the highway too, but not dangerously light or sensitive (like our Harrier TD cars). In fact, at certain speeds, you’ll feel that the steering is slow & vague around the center (just as well since the Hector is no handler). Its turning radius of 5.95m is way too big for an SUV of this size! You will surely be making 3-point turns more often than not. The ground clearance (laden) is rated at 180 mm for the petrol and 175 mm for the diesel. This GC is more than enough in real world conditions.

All variants get disc brakes at the rear as well, with ABS + EBD. The brakes perform as expected. No complaints.

McPherson strut suspension setup at the front...


...and a semi-independent helical spring torsion beam at the rear:",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Other Points

• Huge shoutout to BHPian t2k4 for sharing an excellent ownership report of his Hector Petrol DCT.

• Available in 4 variants - Style (base), Super, Smart & Sharp (top). Silly sounding variant names, if you ask me, and you'll see the same with lots of Chinese cars. The petrol auto is limited to the top 2 variants, while the petrol hybrid comes in all, except the base. The petrol non-hybrid manual is available only in the Style and Super variants.

• In the 1960s, everyone said Japanese cars are a joke and the Japanese weren't making proper cars. In the 1980s, Korean cars were said to be a joke and that the Koreans would never be able to make proper cars. In the 2010s, they said that the Chinese won't make proper cars. You know where this is going... .

• The Hector is big on the “wow” factor. Family members & friends who sat inside were “wowed” by the panoramic sunroof, tablet ICE & comfort levels. They bought into the “British” branding and refused to believe this is a Chinese car. On the road, this thing turns heads like Amitabh Bachchan (had experienced the same kind of attention with the 2009 Fortuner, XUV500 & Harrier). Indians love SUVs. Period. A dude in an Elantra followed GTO into a McDonalds drive-through just to ask some questions!

• The Hector is manufactured at the ex-GM factory in Halol. MG has invested Rs. 2,200 crore in it and has plans to invest another Rs. 3,000 crore over the next 5 years. Make no mistake, SAIC is very serious about India. India is also the easiest Top 5 worldwide market to crack (USA, Japan, Germany etc. are way more mature).

• The company has recently opened bookings again (related news).

• I'm very happy that despite China being a LHD country, the light & wiper stalks are oriented properly for us, a RHD country.

• I find it a bit odd that for the next track (while playing music), you have to move the steering's track button down, and for the previous track, you have to push it upwards. Even in the Hyundai Venue, it was like this. Are manufacturers going the other way now?

• Super cool - electric tailgate! Even if you manually push it partially, it does the rest by itself. Also note that uniquely, when you press the boot open from the inside (dashboard) button, it opens & closes on its own, without any user intervention!

• Long-press the unlock button on the keyfob and it will roll down all the windows + sunroof. Handy if parked in the sun and you want to cool down the car.

• Despite the lack of physical A/C controls, the 'Hello MG' voice commands work brilliantly. 9/10 times, it recognised our command correctly. Some of them include open / close the sunroof, set A/C temperature to XX-degrees, adjust fan speed, play radio, etc.

• Team-BHP fan Dweep Advani had sent a questionnaire to MG Motors and to his surprise, they replied to it. Read it here.

• Long 5-year / unlimited km standard warranty offered along with complimentary 24x7 roadside assistance. Main reason for this long warranty is to allay fears around an unknown product from an unknown Chinese company.

• Maintenance plans start at Rs. 8,000 for 3 years / 30,000 km for the petrol and Rs. 15,000 for 3 years / 45,000 km for the diesel. They go all the way up to 5 years / 50,000 km and 5 years / 75,000 km for the petrol & diesel variants respectively. Buyers are also offered an assured buyback price of 60% of the ex-showroom price after 3 years which is a gimmick (works out to ~50% of the actual price which you'll easily better by selling it yourself).

• First service visit is at 1,000 km / 1 month (just a checkup), second at 5,000 km / 6 months and third at 10,000 km / 12 months. Subsequent services every 10,000 km / 12 months. The initial five services are labour free.

• Doors auto-lock at 10 km/h. You can set them to auto-unlock through the ICE.

• Similar to VW cars, there is a small cutout on the ORVMs, from which you can see the blinking indicator as well. ORVMs are heated as well, improving visibility in the rains.

• On setting off without anyone wearing the front seatbelts, the seatbelt warning lamp in the instrument cluster starts blinking. A warning chime accompanies it. Despite such measures & more, 75% of drivers in India don't buckle up - related thread. Manufacturers are trying hard, yet the masses simply lack common sense!

Highlights:

- Bought (not leased) a 46,000 sq. ft. office for Rs. 150 crore.
- Out of 1,200 employees, only 20 are Chinese. 30% of employees on the shop floor are women.
- Startup culture. Management wears smart casuals to work.
- In another 3 years, MG Motor will have 5 products on sale.
- Rs. 5,000 crore investment planned.
- To ensure profitability of dealers, there is only one dealer per city (except New Delhi & Mumbai).
- Chinese management is open to suggestions. Changed grille design (to suit Indian tastes) in 2 weeks.
- Rajeev Chaba is reporting directly to the President of SAIC. No multi-layered management structure.
- Originally planned to launch a sub-5 lakh hatchback, but changed course to launch a premium SUV.
- American companies like GM are too Wall Street-focused (quarter on quarter profits). But SAIC is patient and ready to invest.

The Wall Street bit is an interesting comment. Most big automobile company CEOs do not take investment risks because they have to face the shareholders every quarter!

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"The Smaller yet Significant Things

Apart from the Aurora Silver of our test car, the Hector is offered in Candy White...


...Burgundy Red...


...Glaze Red, and also Starry Black:


All MG dealerships have this cut-out model of the door, insulation foam and shock absorber. MG claims to use sheet metal that's thicker than others in the market. We also think they are using stiffer door hinges to give that impression


Full cladding in the front wheel well...


...and in the rear too. Road noise is well-controlled:


Hector gets a 60L fuel tank. It is larger than some rivals such as the Harrier (50L) & Creta (55L), equal in size to the Compass (60L) and smaller than the XUV500 (70L):


LED headlamps do a good job of lighting up the road:


High beam too is LED and effective. Other drivers will distinctly notice when you flash the Hector's headlamps:


Ugly keyfob has a shape unlike others! Looks weird:


There are a total of 8 different mood-lighting colours to choose from. Here are some of them. Around the front cup-holders...


...the footwells...


...and the door pockets. This adds a feel good factor to the interior...and some more bling too!


Both front occupants get individual seatbelt warnings. Very necessary in India, where most people are least concerned & ignorant with regards to car safety. Manufacturers should add this feature to all seats:


It's these small details that matter. The MID marks in red which door is open. It also warns you about the boot & bonnet (so many cars skip the bonnet for whatever strange reason):


Weirdly, the DTE reading stops once the fuel tank hits reserve. It was showing ""80 km"" left until the reserve warning came on. Then, the DTE stopped! How silly, as that's the exact time that you'll need the DTE the most. LOL, what was MG thinking?


A premium touch = faux leather covers up the ugly gap between the dashboard & steering console:


Automatic variants get a larger storage bin in the center console, thanks to the lack of a physical handbrake lever:


It has a 12V power outlet as well:


Both the front mats are superbly locked in place with these press-type clips. In this single image itself, you can see THREE mentions of MG - the company hasn't wasted any opportunity in trumpeting the British connection:


Tyre pressure of 33 PSI to be maintained at the front & rear, irrespective of the load:


VIN is lightly stamped on a beam below the front passenger's seat. There is a neat flap to conceal it:


Sad horn. It's a dual-tone unit, but the choice of sound is poor. Equally disappointing is the fact that the horn is too loud inside the cabin:


Seatbelts can be parked in these slots (when folding the rear seat down):


Notice how the door curves downwards and covers the sideboard of the car:


Infinity amplifier sits under the rear-right passenger seat:


The maps show your current speed as well as the speed limit of the road you're on


Uniquely, MG has handed over the press fleet logistics to Myles by Carzonrent. Must say that it worked like a charm! The driver was on time and there were prompt updates on the location of the car (left the premises, on the way, etc). At handover, I was asked to take a walk-around video of the vehicle. And yes, the car was a white plate car and not one with a commercial black + yellow plate. I wish this is the test drive experience all potential owners get:


Overspeed warning comes up at 80 km/h and doesn't go away unless you fiddle with the MID, or slow down. Notice how it's designed just like the road signs! While the warning at 80 km/h feels a bit overboard, we're happy with the 120 km/h warning - it's a well-selected chime:


While this is not visible normally, recline the front seat too far back and its mechanism is exposed. This is the difference between ""good"" fit & finish and an ""excellent"" one:


What would be armrests for the 3rd row seats. Notice the different shapes of the left and right units:


Plastic cover for the area in which the seatbelts would be housed for the 3rd row. Make no mistake, if & when it comes, that will be for kids only:",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Thread moved from the Assembly Line to Official Reviews. Thanks for sharing! The definitive review of a very important car .

In terms of strategy, this is the stuff of business case studies in MBA classrooms. How a Chinese giant entered India, re-branded the product & company via a British marque they acquired earlier, the VFM pricing, the aggressive marketing, all the bling & features thrown in…MG really got it spot on. It’s quite an achievement for MG Motor to have garnered the volumes they did in a damp market. The Chinese hit the bull's eye with their choice of segment too; if MG had brought in a hatchback or budget sedan, they would've sunk like the Titanic. Trivia: This is actually SAIC's 4th product in India, after the Sail UVA, Sail sedan & Enjoy MPV (all of them bombed). Just look at how they turned their fortunes around with this SUV.

In terms of product, I think the Hector is a good choice for those looking at calm + refined + comfortable cruising, whether on the highway or in the city. I took it on a road-trip to Pune and my family absolutely loved it! I have to admit that I enjoyed the easy cruising experience too. On the other hand, if you’re looking at driving pleasure, there are better options (Compass, Seltos etc. are all superior handlers & more satisfying to drive). For automatic lovers too, there are better gearboxes. The sole positive thing about the MG AT is that it's smooth, but in every other area, it is beaten by the competition (even the Mahindra & Tata ATs in the XUV500 & Hexa are next level compared to this DCT).

Poor ol' Maruti is watching with envy as everyone mints money in the lucrative Rs. 15 - 20 lakh SUV segment. Good volumes + FAT margins. Little Suzuki simply doesn't have the talent to make a nice premium SUV in this segment. Now that they have big-daddy Toyota on their side, maybe we'll see something from the alliance in the future.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"It took a while to come, so we knew it was going to be exhaustive. But this review is to a different level altogether. Exceptional level of detail. Kudos BlackWasp & the team for it. Rated 5 Stars. Congratulations on the superb coverage done.

The level of detail per post is so much, that as much as I want to discuss some points, its impossible to keep that a small discussion. But the car had enough quirks already. They didn't need that last bit of ""nazar suraksha kawach"" in the form of a counter clock-wise sweeping tachometer. Just can't find a reason for that. Everything else has at least some explanation...

Its an immense VFM package; especially in the diesel guise. I hope they launch an automatic one soon. Like I mentioned elsewhere in another thread, the car deserves to be noticed, appreciated & the huge booking backlog is a true reflection on what the package has to offer. It has quirks, polarizing looks, gizmos, negatives. However - the positives, capabilities & sheer value for money outweigh them all by a huge margin. Step back incumbents, we have a new brand MG & its here with a statement. Its only as much Chinese as everything else that we use. So no need of prejudice against it. In fact - the brand has invested a lot in India and is creating a good amount of direct and indirect employment for our people. Its good in the big picture.

I never agree with anyone much easily. But there is not a single line in this review which I'm not agreeing with. I'm surprised with that.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Brilliant review. Amazing amount of detail. And the huge number of photos. They really do a great job in making it more in depth. After reading the review I'm glad that I've made the right choice in booking a Hector Diesel 2.0. As someone who was in the market for a family car, this one ticked all boxes.

I remember I saw full wheel cladding and the photos in the review reaffirmed the same. Competition needs to take note.

Also, more good news for those who are waiting for their Hector to be delivered. 3536 Units of the Hector retailed in October 2019. So they're doing a pretty good job in ramping up the production.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"During the official drive in June, Vid6639 and I took a diesel version up to Kotagiri/Coonoor from Coimbatore. It was very easy to get used to. On the roads around Mettupalaya, it was perfectly fine. On the hillclimb going up - 170bhp+ twisties - a red rag to me, I gave it the beans. The good stuff was that it could overtake slow trucks uphill with ease, when conditions permitted.

The bad news was that it just did not like it. It was like a spouse shrugging and saying ""ok, I'll go along with it if you must"". My arms ached from the understeer but the tyres surprising held on.

We took the petrol hybrid for the ride down. Less nose heavy but it could not keep up with another Hector diesel in the convoy. It was very unhappy and Vid6639 handed the car over to me. I completed the descent, driving ""normally"" and it was perfectly fine, your obedient servant. It will satisfy 80% of typical car buyers needs.

Fit and finish was impressive for the price. Some niggles like
The lag in compute intense applications like GPS
Auto wipers during misty rain reacted like trying to catch a flea, one minutes clapping around, and another minute waiting and waiting for water to be detected when right there!
Some loose threads in the stitching!

For a first effort, its not bad but it is no way related to the MG of old",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Rating this 5 star. Simply brilliant detail.

When I first saw the ads with Benedict I rolled my eyes over thinking here is one more Chinese company trying to hoodwink us with a brand name change and getting an A List British actor to drive perception of a Chinese product. The Sail twins left a lasting impression of how bad Chinese products can be..

I heard from my colleague who worked in China that the Chinese are not necessarily cheap , but they can manufacture a product in any given price and You get what you pay for.


I first saw MG Hector in the Mumbai airport about 4 months back and was wowed and felt an amazing level of detail for the price had been put into the product. The definitive review from Team BHP further validates the worthiness of the product.

Only miss and this is a big one is lack of Diesel Autobox. Personally when I was on the lookout for a car from a full segment lower, Diesel + Auto was a decidong factor and sone one plonking close to 20 lakhs for a product will expect the convenience an auto box offers.

Unlike Harrier this product has enough grunt and value to be relevant in the market till the time an Diesel Autobox arrives.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"A fantastic review to say the least. Thank you for the extraordinary amount of detail and the effort that goes into producing such praise-worthy content. The bar keeps getting higher with new Offical Reviews.

A couple of points come to mind:

1. Will the Hector also suffer from some teething issues akin to what happened to the first batches of XUV 500? The interior quality appears to be better than what XUV 500 offered on its launch. However, there are similarities in terms of misses. The software misses can be easily (hopefully) remedied by OTA updates - the other stuff is TBD.

2. A single dealer in each city philosophy that Skoda also followed when they launched Octavia many years ago is meant to attract new dealers and their investment. However, does it not put the car owners at a disadvantage? Hyundai, for instance, has 5+ dealers in close proximity to each other where I live and it offers peace of mind to visit a different dealer if the experience at a given service setup is not optimal.

Of course, Hyundai has many classes of cars that they sell and dealers won't complain about the competition since the pie is bigger but if MG is going with this mindset to only assign one dealer in a given radius and probably will have to commit to a non-compete assurance in writing when they sign up new dealers - it's just taking away leverage from the customers and placing them on the backfoot to some degree.

Thoughts?",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Great review as always

I too think Hector is a perfect example to any car maker, who wants to enter Indian market and taste success. Also got a strong feeling that MG is here to stay.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"First of all, rated the review 5 stars! Commendable job!!!

Secondly, wow! Just WOW!!!

I'm truly blown away with the feature list and the little nitty-gritties MG has provided! It is hard for me to believe that this is a INR 15-20L car!!! This along with the Seltos, have hit the competition out of the park! While Hyundai might survive this onslaught with the next generation Creta, all the other players must be wetting their pants off thinking about their strategies in this price bracket. MG has hit the right chord with the Hector for the Indian market - bling and feature list, the masses love these and it is not really a surprise as to how they've responded to the launch! Heck, my father would be a proud owner of one!

That said, no matter how many useful/useless features there are in a car, I'd prefer one that is mechanically sorted and I'm pretty sure the Hector isn't. The amount of ""Internet Inside"" is a perfect recipe for many things to go wrong. Also, did I mention that the exterior design is mostly ""yuck""? The Duster and Harrier would still be my choice (yes, even with their own set of problems) but their already abysmal sales would be halved since the masses would prefer the Hector over them. Seltos and Compass are more expensive which is Hector's real trump card, pricing!

To summarize, I'm happy that MG and Kia are redefining the rules in the INR 15-20L price bracket and while their current crop of cars are not really my thing, I will surely be cheering for them because I'm eagerly waiting for what they could do with the INR 5-10L price bracket!!!",,,,,,,

Lack of good engines available to them in India that can do justice to the car's potential while still keeping cost in correct bracket.

Lack of planning to localize it at right time to ensure low cost. By the time it arrives, it will have a gang of incumbents to fight with. MSIL has been very short sighted and has handed over the segment in a jewel studded gold plate to others.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"A well written review. Caters to all the questions I had and then some I didn't even think of.

The hector sure has drawn more petrol SUV buyers than any other SUV offered in India till now. What struck me the most was the torque on offer in the turbo-petrol engine and it's refinement. During a very short test drive, engine noise was absolutely undetectable in the evening rush hour traffic. The engine seems to be a GM / Daewoo derived engine. S-tec series engines have the 3 letter naming system starting with 'L'.

Another thing it did was that it got me thinking seriously about hybrid power-trains, albeit the mild version on offer. Till now, they were out of my reach and I never considered them as an option. This was the first time I tried it hands on and thought of how hybrids can help petrol engines come closer to achieving diesel engine fuel economy numbers.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Great review and a fantastic first product by MG!

I am just worried about all the electronics in the car with plethora of sensors; would be a test for MG's commitment to train all those service personnel, failing which we will see a huge number of disgruntled Hector owners in 3-5 years down the line!
Not to mention the ""internet inside"" and host of remote controlled features potentially inspiring novel ways from carjackers!",,,,,,,

Hector is a good car. I will soon be switching over to an SUV from a sedan and Hector is on the top of my list. However, the missing diesel AT is a blocker. 5.7 kmpl (as highlighted in another thread) for a petrol automatic is abysmal. Hope they good out with a AT soon.

Probably because they have covered up the top portion of the engine bay with so much plastic, that if full fledged underbody engine guard is provided, it might reduce the flow rate of hot air removal from engine bay, and lead to some major problem.

Picturize the visit of a typical middle-aged indian buyer to the MG showroom :

(1) Sunroof ? yes, big one, panoramic
(2) Touchscreen ? yes big one (dont care about touch lag or boot time).
(3) android auto / apple-car play ? Of course yes.
(4) DRLs ? yes, excellent ones which makes it look like iron man.
(5) Flat floor in rear ? yes, no more footwell wars with the middle passenger.
(6) Very nice seats and excellent looking interior ? of course, have a seat and take a look.
(7) Enough charging sockets ? yes.
(8) Very nice and quiet, with an excellent sounding music system ? oh yes.

The customer is already sold.

Then he sees how the IRVM has a USB charging socket to plug in the power source for his dashcam that he would install later, and thinks - wow, MG has thought about everything that I will need. Let me book the car.

Probably 1 out of 200 customers will actually find out that high speed ride and steering feedback and body roll are poor during test drive, and will reject the car for those reasons. The only reason all the other 199 people will not book it, will be due to price negotiations failing and/or insanely high waiting period of more than 6 months, and/or due to not liking the way it looks.

Same goes with the way the rear looks (reminds me of a primate with red bottom), weird tacho and cheapskate 'internet inside' badging. Nothing wrong if many of them like it.

This car is a perfect example of why extensive and exhaustive market research is the cornerstone of a successful product. No wonder the booking numbers are through the roof.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Drove it the very next day after my friend got delivery and was thoroughly unimpressed. It's not a SUV. It can be clubbed with MUV vehicles like Marazzo, Innova. It has only bling but no wow factor. The car understeers. The gear ratios are optimised for city driving and not for highways or overtaking.

I am not surprised that a Chinese vehicle has been so appreciated here knowing Indian car customers who purchased 1st gen Santro and Brio (hands down the ugliest car ever)[no offense to respective owners]. Chinese steel quality is doubtful and it is not controversial. I will not be surprised if we see a lot of stranded hectors. Several things downgrade steel - most notably is the actual chemistry. Each grade of steel has a specific set of elements in specific allowable amounts to be that grade - min X% carbon, A to B% silicon, maximum D% sulfur, etc. You then have non-metallic inclusions that can be present - often called slivers in the coil market. Silvers when present in exposed coils do not let the paint adhere to them causing the part to be defected. You also specify the allowable width, thickness, crown [thinner at the edge than the center], and cobble [undulations] in the coil.

The ""poor quality"" of the steel is that it may not meet the above criteria. Slivers require the coils to be inspected and the actual chemistry requires testing to verify, and Chinese steel right or wrong has a reputation of not maintaining the standards required by the customer or of trying to pass off lower grade [marks, sliver count, borderline chemistry, etc] steel as prime steel.

And then I think they may go the mobile phone route. Churning out models after models at cheap prices so that customers may forget about previous models and its hardships and new naive first time customer will fall into their trap with their audacious advertising. Who remembers 6 months old Vivo, Oppo, Realme, Xiaomi,one+ models and their quality.

Then there is a whole lot question about what sort of paint, pu and plastics they are using. China is known for carcinogenic products and their shenanigans. ""Chinese drywall"" is a term for problem drywall installed in buildings along the Gulf Coast states and in Virginia. Most of these homes had new drywall installed between 2001 and 2009. Some people who installed that drywall have reported health problems such as coughing, shortness of breath, nausea, headaches and fatigue. Federal agency investigations found the drywall from China gave off high levels of hydrogen sulfide indoors.

Laminate flooring manufactured in China between 2012 and 2014 also tested as emitting high levels of formaldehyde in recent investigations. Reportedly, that flooring is no longer sold in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends several steps to reduce exposure including opening windows and using exhaust fans.

Even a giant like Mattel had to recall over 1 million products due to lead paint toys. If a multi billion global manufacture can not control its OEM then it will be worth watching how a Chinese car maker adhere to its norm if it has any. Thomas and friend another giant also had lead paint in their wooden toys. Mind you it's not a house where windows and doors are open and has enough ventilation. The car has less than 80sft of space and most people keep it closed with same air recirculating inside.

I have seen enough Chinese products in my life and can never be satisfied with any Chinese origin products unless and until a strict third party has thoroughly inspected and cleared it. Then there is always some privacy issues and security issues with ""internet connected"" cars. I still can not forget the death of renowned journalist Michael Hastings who investigated CIA and NSA of USA and whose car is believed to be hacked to crash and burn. But we are not that important, still privacy is something now that has to be kept in this interconnected world.

I'll buy a Harrier any day over Hector or even a Hexa but then I just bought a Dzire 30 days back so whom am I to suggest or judge.",,,,,,,

So true. And that is my thoughts as well. They have really done their research well. And seen that the Indian car scene is still at the aspirational level. And I mean no offense in that!

Specifically wanted to quote this point. I really get very, very tired when people constantly bash Chinese products - even here.

That's a bit unfair, IMHO - whether we like it or not, manufacturing for anything and everything in the world has been/is moving into china. That's their USP as a country. They make everything from 5 rupee LEDs to iPhones to steel subframes for satellites. Built for cost - there are both cheap carcinogenic products and high quality medical grade surgical products. So, what price are you willing for pay for something, that determines what china gives you in return.

How can you assure yourselves that tata/maruti are not sourcing equally (or worse) carcinogenic plastics from local suppliers and putting it as dashboard in your current/future car ?
Simple answer is, there is no way to know. We are buying and eating vegetables laden with carcinogenic pesticides and mangoes artificially sweetened and yellowed with cadmium. Interior plastics of cars causing health issues is the least of the worries of an average indian.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Superb review and rated 5 stars.

As reported by others, my family too was floored during our first test drive of the Hector. As my requirement was strictly of an automatic, only the DCT variant fit my needs. The test drive itself was short due to the traffic and foot fall in July. This car gave so many features and asked for so little, literally made me blind to its flaws. My 6 year old daughter was simply ecstatic to the 'Hello MG' voice command. My wife couldn't see beyond the space and the sunroof. I think its one of the few cars whose sunroof is truly panoramic and even the rear passengers can enjoy it. So not to be the one who would miss the offer, I ended up booking it. I didn't really mind the 50K as the wait was going to be long and had enough time to make a decision.

And finally the Team-BHP review comes after a gruelling wait. It did confirm my suspicions about the DCT variant. In fact just last week I cancelled my booking as I wasn't fully convinced of the purchase. The DCT just couldn't read my mind in my second longer test drive. It struggled to quickly close the gaps in moderate Mumbai traffic. Also, although subjective, I prefer understated looks.

Don't get me wrong, its a wonderful product at the price point. If you keep the political biases aside, I think the Chinese products are really great value for money at a particular price point and their cars are no different. I think the future would be interesting and these Chinese brands, as long as they create local jobs, are the much needed 'Price Correction Factor' and competition which the Indian auto industry needs.",,,,,,,

In my opinion, the chinese ownership is the advantage here. They have deep pockets, they've done their research and they've cracked the market. And they're the best when it comes to delivering quality while keeping the costs at a minimum.

On what basis do you foresee 'stranded hectors'? As per the Team BHP review, the interior quality is good, the body is sturdy and the diesel engine variant drives really well. The car is well build overall and gives bang for the buck. Highway dynamics aren't the best but honestly, when did we buy cars only for their highway characteristics?

The heart of a car is it's engine. And here, MG has done well to take Fiat's tried and tested diesel engine and the gearbox. Which is why, an old school purist like me is convinced.

Your opinion regarding Chinese products is a bit biased. Look at the iPhone. Made in China. Look at the upcoming ZS EV. Made in China. The interior quality is stellar.

The way MG is going, it's got a gameplan. And it's here to stay. And the way things are, no one's complaining. Hopefully it'll be a wake up call for the older manufacturers to up their game.",,,,,,,

Yes iPhone is made in China, and that's all.

1. iPhone is neither developed in China nor developed by any Chinese company. Hector is mostly developed in China, by a Chinese company.

2. iPhone though made in China, specifications and quality related decisions were not in the hands of the Chinese maker, but it's not the same in case of Hector aka Baojun 530.

3. Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo didn't try to hide their Chinese origin, they were bold in their approach. That's how SAIC should approach our market if they have any confidence in their product and themselves.

4. If Tata were to slap a Land-Rover badge on Hexa and pass it on as a JLR vehicle will it become a true British car or can anyone in the know accept it as a true LR car. But SAIC is taking Baojun 530 and passing it on as a MG car, it maybe legally okay but not ethically. But the poor Tata's were doing just the opposite, they're trying to give an LR platform at an affordable price with Tata badge, they're bold in their approach despite the failures in their way.

5. Tata Indica being sold as MG Rover's CityRover is not Tata doing it but MG Rover doing it, so it's not the Tata's fault/mistake but MG Rover's. They are just buying it from Tata, slapping their badge, and are selling it.

Respects to Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, and Tata, but not to the manipulative MG aka SAIC.

Note, these were my thoughts, don't get offended and take it personal.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Nobody has leveraged a 'brand buy' as brilliantly as SAIC. Not Tata, nor Mahindra. In fact I often discuss this with colleagues (and even on TBHP this deserves to be a thread on its own). The Nexon has all the attributes to make it a 'Mini-Land Rover', it has a solid build and everything just works brilliantly, but what stops Tata from slapping the badge on it? They can make chassis/platform changes, maybe add a 4X4, price it well and leverage the brand. They will certainly get volumes, both in India and China, as that's the market requirement. There is news that Tata might let go of Jaguar and Land Rover, so who is to be blamed here? (If only they had been smart about it). Harrier carries the LR legacy right? So why were so many glitches reported at launch? Isn't it akin to killing 'brand LR', since expectations were sky high? Such a beautiful car, but doing so poorly! Harrier doesn't deserve this. What has Mahindra gained from its acquisitions like Reva and SsyangYong? Have they used it to the hilt? The market is quite unforgiving and there are only winners and losers. Use every trick in the book to get ahead. You have seen departures like GM and Ford, who just did not research the market enough and launch relevant products. (EcoSport is an exception). SAIC has a winner in MG, a dead brand which they have revived successfully, we need to accept that fact. Hector has resonated with us Indians, in spite of being Chinese (and the baggage that comes with it). Respects to brand Tata and Mahindra (I really mean this), but these are my thoughts.

This car is an interesting blend of funk over function, and a lesson for me on how important research and marketing can be for a product.

The car has all the bells and whistles to attract the mainstream consumers, who want a point A to B vehicle having the highest bling per rupee.

This isn't a vehicle meant to be nurtured for 10+ years.
It's the car for ""it's time"": use it for 5-7 years max, get over it and get a new one. Consumerism at it's finest.

Hector will seem a good buy for people who buy the car based on specs rather than their own hands-on experience.

The addition of a USB port for the dashcam indicates that there are right people at the right places. However, the absolutely horrendous badging of ""Internet Inside"" makes me want to read the minutes of the meeting where it was discussed (if at all).

Having a turning radius of approx 6 metres is the first made me gawk!
My Skoda Octavia has a turning radius of 5.2m! That means the longer Octavia shall be a much more easier car to park than this vehicle.

The ""poor quality"" of the steel is that it may not meet the above criteria.

Churning out models after models at cheap prices so that customers may forget about previous models ...... Who remembers 6 months old Vivo, Oppo, Realme, Xiaomi,one+ models and their quality.

China is known for carcinogenic products and their shenanigans.

Even a giant like Mattel had to recall over 1 million products due to lead paint toys.

Hi there!

After reading your commentary, for a minute, I thought we were all in a WTO summit and arguing dumping duties on Chinese steel.

Without going into the chemistry of what makes steel tick - am not an ore specialist by any stretch of the imagination - there are tens if not hundreds of things to consider when manufacturers plan a car. Steel is one component. Hardly any manufacturer these days builds all the parts themselves.

Takata is world-renowned for Airbags. A Japanese company, supplier to top brands, the likes of Honda and Toyota. They had a big issue with the Airbags which led to massive recalls.

Toyota had braking issues on Prius leading to massive recalls.

Cars and Phones and Toys are different genres requiring a different level of investment and commitment. Manufacturers have figured out a way to quickly produce new phone models. Cars assembly lines are a different beast.

To plan and manufacture a new car - I am assuming tons of work goes into R&D, Aerodynamic, Sketch, Visualization, Field Testing, Safety, Crash Ratings, and the whole nine yards.

It's not comparable to an INR 10,000 phone that you can buy with cashback offers.

Quality concerns are genuine with Chinese merchandise and so is the risk and reputation loss on tens (hundreds) of millions of dollars of investment.

The question is whether SAIC / MG is committed to the long term game. No one can predict that, not even SAIC. It's all market-driven. American cars didn't come to India with an intent to only do business for x years and then leave.

Automobile Industry is tightly knit worldwide. Each company has a stake in another.

Daimler controls Mercedes.

Volkswagen controls Audi, Seat, Skoda, Buggati, Bentley, Porsche, and Lamborghini.

PSA controls DS, Peugeot, and Citroen.

FCA controls FIAT and Chrysler (part ownership)

..and then there's Toyota, Honda, Ford, TATA, Renault, Hyundai, Nissan, Geely, and the BMW Group.

FCA and PSA are considering marriage.

Here's an infographic (not my creation) that illustrates this:



++

No brand can really create chaos and escape without some consequence.

Indian car ownership laws are not very strong - easy to get taken for a ride (pun intended).

But, can't single out Chinese car companies yet - too early to comment.

When Skoda arrived, everyone accused them of dumping inferior technology - Pump Duse - in India. Octavia was the first aggressively priced value-for-money car in a long time to land on our shores. They beat the pants off the competition. Mitsubishi Lancer was the segment king/queen. They never recovered from the Skoda onslaught.

XUV 500 did the same in the SUV/MUV segment in the INR 15 lacs range. Were there problems in that car? Yes. Did people still buy? Yes.

Hector's faux leather may have long-term carcinogenic effects - I don't have evidence. But, our Air Quality may kill us sooner. Delhi had an AQI of 795 yesterday. Can't blame the Chinese for that.

If people want to chase brand names, they are free to buy any brand name - most are available in India. You can even import the ones not available and pay the duty.

Robert Downey Jr. couldn't lift up HTC.

Benedict Cumberbatch is not going to lead a revolution. It's the hard product that will talk.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Even though the imposition date of BS6 is nearing, MG is in no hurry to announce cutoff date for BS6 production. With thousands of fresh orders in phase 2, MG wouldn't want to scare people off and disrupt the momentum, which is evident from the fact that no matter which showroom in NCR I checked, none of them had the new pricelist. MG wanted to keep things low key w.r.t the new pricing so as to continue to look as a brilliant value proposition.

MG had claimed they had a backlog of 24000 bookings, this was after they said they had 8000 new bookings. Now that has gone up to 10,000. So 26000 odd bookings in all. So around 16000 bookings of June/ July still pending, majority DCT and Hybrid. It's safe to assume, not all the bookings will be met by March 2020 ( even if MG ramps up production to 4500 cars a month after the second shift stabilises, which is also a stage wise ramp up - different departments scale up differently. So around 3600 despatches in Oct. So maybe close to 4000 in November and taking it up closer to 4500 in Dec). So I'm sure a lot of people who booked now and get ready for the deliveries in April are going to have a price shocker.

MG is not going to absorb any more price hikes nor is it extending it's rewards points program beyond July bookings. So people who booked Sept onwards are already looking at a 50-70k hit. Post BS6, it'll be atleast a 70k-100k hike for the diesel variants, maybe half of that for petrol.",,,,,,,

Chinese steel quality is doubtful and it is not controversial. I will not be surprised if we see a lot of stranded hectors. Several things downgrade steel - most notably is the actual chemistry. Each grade of steel has a specific set of elements in specific allowable amounts to be that grade - min X% carbon, A to B% silicon, maximum D% sulfur, etc. You then have non-metallic inclusions that can be present - often called slivers in the coil market. Silvers when present in exposed coils do not let the paint adhere to them causing the part to be defected. You also specify the allowable width, thickness, crown [thinner at the edge than the center], and cobble [undulations] in the coil.
'Sliver' as you have mentioned generally appear during hot rolling (HRC) process. These coils undergo several processes - pickling, annealing, cold rolling before being used as car bodies. It is highly unlikely that a sliver will go undetected through these processes.

'Cobble' is when the hot material gets stuck during the rolling process. You will not be seeing steel coils being produced after a cobble. The undulations are called 'edge waves' when the edges are thinner than the center and 'center buckle' when its vice versa.

Thanks for bringing the memories back. The last Hot Rolled Coil I produced was in 2005.

A big +1 to this and I could not have expressed this better. Having driven the Fiat Linea T-Jet for the past 9 years, I was still surprised at how easy and quickly I got used to Hector even though I had realized right from the word go that the Hector car is not meant to be driven hard or is nowhere close to being an enthusiast's car.
Other than driving dynamics, it probably does everything else better and for me the added advantage is that my wife is raring to drive the Hector, unlike the Linea, which she loved as a car but never came close to being comfortable as a driver in, with the heavy steering, low and awkward driver position, not the most friendly and snappy gear-box and a gem of an engine but one that was always ready to leap out since she isn't used to driving a turbocharged car!",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Amazing review with extensive details. Kudos !! This just can't better.

The review and further posts by fellow BHPians validated and clarified my observations, assumptions and experience about MG Hector. During last couple of weeks, I TDed a number of vehicles, including MG Hector. Some of them were TDed twice or thrice.

First impression of the Hector, wow wow and wow. Amazing space, the cabin looks very practical from every aspect, I especially liked the second row flat floor. The large panoramic sun-roof is extremely gorgeous and further increases the feel of large practical space. When I TDed, it was drizzling a bit, and the sunroof experience in rain of Hector was very beautiful. I found overall cabin quality to be very impressive - seats, upholstery, door panels and fascia are all nicely finished. I was sold on Hector then and there.

Another best thing that I like about MG is its remote powered trunk operations. Its so very convenient and practical.

I TDed MG Hector multiple times. First I tried the petrol. The engine cabin is so silent, I was simply amazed. However, I felt that engine is a bit sluggish, under-powered, lethargic and extremely unresponsive, especially when in bumper to bumper traffic situation or at signals. Kept me wondering, what will happen when Hector is fully loaded with passengers and luggage. One need to apply more throttle than usual with Hector petrol, no wonder why some people are getting a mileage of 6~7 Km/lt. Kind of a setback to me and dropped the plan to consider petrol version any further.

Then, I TDed the diesel version and that too twice. First impression, Hector has contained the NVH levels extremely well and engine felt way way better and powerful. However, I found the suspension a bit soggy especially on potholes and uneven road.

Second time I asked my friend to TD the vehicle and he steered Hector a bit aggressively. Felt a lot of body roll and as per my friend Hector lacks driving feel and is not holding firmly on road. Remember Toyota Qualis, it just reminded me of that.

In fact, it would be extremely wrong to label Hector as a Chinese product. MG Hector may be termed as American car? Why, because its nothing but latest Chevrolet Captiva that has been launched worldwide in 2019. In that case, it could even be a Korean brand, as Captiva was first owned by Daewoo. At best we can say, its an American car developed by Chinese.





As GM has already exited India, question was how it should enter again and make a comeback? Create a new brand and a new image without any legacy implication. And leverage all the assets of GM, including its old manufacturing plant. I think MG is here to stay for long, given its GM backing. We shouldn't be too concerned as Hector launch in India is just part of overall global launch of Chevrolet Captiva, albeit in a re-badge form. So, no one is going to be hoodwinked. For sure, its not a British car.

Indeed, absolutely true. They have done extensive research and have read the aspirations of Indian customers very well. There studies, for sure would have shown that Indian customers like to have nice design, spacious interior, digital tech and value-for-money factor. Moreover, the studies would have also shown that for majority first priority is not performance and ride quality. I think, MG has hit the sweet-spot extremely well.

In fact, Hector's launch could be a perfect case-study to be taught in B-schools. Four brands and a well synchronized global launch. From superb entry strategy by GM, branding to market research and excellent execution of the strategy. Full marks to GM on pulling this so well.

Very true, Hector shouldn't be even compared with Compass or such SUVs. How can a 2WD with small tyres be termed as SUV. It's a MPV at best. It's main competition is going to be Innova. Innova should be really worried. Captiva worldwide has been launched in 7 seats too. Lets see how soon GM launched the 7 seat Hector in India, for sure it would be a blood-bath then.





Clearly, in times to come a 7 seater Hector would be a favorite of tour/taxi operators. Question is, will it out space Innova and how fast? I feel prospective Innova customers should wait for the launch of 7 seater Hector.

At the same time, on second thought, this could be a big matter of concern too, if you re-visit how in 2017 General Motors packed up and left Indian customers in utter lurch. Hope that doesn't get repeated.",,,,,,,

I for one don't drive the car in 120 or so continuously and take sharp turns. It's mainly city and even highway I drive my cars in a sedate manner. Guess the Hector is perfect for me.
Didn't like the alloy designs though. And for some reason I prefer the lower Smart grade alloys instead. Happen to see a quick walk around of the Sharp variant in one of the YouTube video.",,,,,,,

Chevrolet Captiva (Hector with an 8 speed CVT) review from Thailand.

Quite a scathing review for the same engine as MG hector DCT paired to a different gearbox.

“While downsized turbo engines are here to stay, there’s simply not enough power in the Captiva especially if you’re going to load up the vehicle with people and stuff. A 143hp power output certainly looks second rate to the similarly sized, forced-induced motors from Ford and Honda producing anywhere between 173-190hp. A Chevrolet executive said: “More power means higher costs.””",,,,,,,

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"I do not know why I have this feeling but MG as a whole is likely to fail within a decade or become that irrelevant brand just like Fiat, Datsun and Nissan are now.

Why do I feel so?

MG Hector is undoubtedly a good car, it at the end has competition. Excellent competition, might I add.

Creta is up for a facelift and it will sell even if it is the same as the horrendous Ix25. Our friend, Brand pull sold the Zen Estillo and is selling that coffee bread box as we type.

Seltos is already taking sales away from others and is setting records. It is a competent product. Dusty baby feels old but is a competent car and the enthusiast favorite (good AWD bro). Scorpio and XUV have brand pull both in urban and rural settings.

Hexa is the wise owner's choice. Just my opinion, I love that car. It's just perfection. Rural India is ruled by Mahindra and Tata so forget about Hector in rural areas.

Hector is bought for bling and/or is bought by a first car owner with a high income who wants to make a statement. While that's like 50% of Indian car owners(no offense), we'll see a lot of Hectors on sale in the used car market within 3 years.

MG will bring the ZS EV but let's be honest, electricals in India are fit as either secondary or city cars. Forget highways.

MG might have made a statement but Chinese companies do have a terrible reputation for competency. I am sure that higher numbers will see a drop in quality. Too much previous experience with this in all fields where I've tried Chinese.

KIA is the brand that'll rise with their entry to this segment. They have security even if they fail. Best case scenario, they become number 3. Worst case scenario, they become Datsun. But they survive. Plus, they have transparency with a public roadmap. That instills trust.

MG has no backing. I love the Hector but it's trying to do too much. While that is attractive, it never ends well. They should have made it a 7 seater to compete with and undercut Crysta. That would have given them better profits and a bigger budget to make it better.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Meanwhile in India, Autocar has reviewed the Hector and while they were concerned with the transmission, fuel efficiency, slow acceleration, the infotainment, the interior fit and finish etc, however managed to give it an 8 /10 score also says its a compelling buy.

""Any doubts about the long-term reliability of what is still an unknown product are taken care of by a five-year warranty and a brand-new dealer network""

https://www.autocarindia.com/car-rev...ad-test-414407


Also in Autocar Seltos gets no rating, while they say good things about Seltos overall - the final verdict has something like this ""Kia isn’t an established name in India and aftersales service and quality is an unknown for now""

I presume you mean in India and not overall. Because Fiat (FCA) & Nissan are still significant biggies elsewhere.

Interesting points you mentioned for sure & indeed a thought provoking idea of using the Hector with some changes to take on the Innova instead.

As for the brand surviving, I think it will do well. The attention to detail in product design is remarkable & not make-do. Little things like even how the engine bay covers, aerodynamic flaps ahead of wheels are actually designed & installed show there is intent. Have a look at those. Its not just ""cheap dump"" approach. There is thoughtful design. One does that only when there is a will to succeed long term. Some things are WAY better than our incumbent SUV leader - M&M in quality, design & implementation on the Hector.

And then there is also investment coming in the form of MG's electric cars that they are already testing. All going well I think they'll do well. It would be a mistake to write them off just now. Too soon IMO. The auto sector is too unpredictable. Biggies like Nissan, Ford, Renault have failed to make a real mark in India even after decades! MG, KIA have done it in 1 year.

Thanks! It definitely looks the part. Plus, undercutting the Crysta with Hector's street presence is a pretty safe move. Although, if they plan on doing that, it will be better to cut on the bling for commercial Hectors just to differentiate.

Fair enough point. . But again, keeping quality with time is not exactly a Chinese strength. SAIC needs excellent quality control. Most of its buyers are gonna try to keep their Hectors for a decade at least.

Agree. But KIA definitely has an advantage right now. Electric is still a decade away in this country. KIA knows that better and they're just introducing cars they're already selling worldwide to generate capital first.

In theory & by usual market rules you are right. But then most rules don't work the same for Maruti in India!!

Rewind a few years. Maruti was caught napping when the Duster (not sub4m I agree), EcoSport, TUV300 et al started literally dancing on the streets in an all new compact SUV segment. It woke up yawning, took its own time to freshen up & launched the Vitara Brezza. The rest is history. It went on to rule the SUV segment across all lengths. Maruti even became the #1 SUV seller trouncing M&M with a single product! (SCross really contributed tiny numbers in sales.)

which ""times"" are you talking about ? both flopped in india. Utterly. Miserably. Even the S-cross has had its sunset. Whats common with all three models the kizashi, Grand Vitara & S-Cross ? They are very un-indianized-suzuki cars, which dont give great FE due to the heavier materials used for construction. That's because two separate production standards (like which exists for swift hatch) - weaker ones for india and stronger ones for international markets were deemed un-necessary citing the low volumes that these were expected to generate. And predictably, these failed the litmus test ""kitna deti hai"" and subsequently flopped. Another important reason is that indian car market is extremely class conscious, maruti badge is only for just-graduated-from-2wheeler lower/middle class and not for the urban rich and sethjis (they would consider the ""S"" badge either as their 2nd or 3rd car for shopping/misc runs and not as their 'mainstay' car). A sethji would suffer a tremendous ego hit if he parks his ""S"" badged kizashi next to his employee's ""S"" badged wagonR in his jewellery store's parking lot.

Sir, it seems there has been an misunderstanding. I was implying that times have changed since the period in which the Kizashi was available in our market.

After reading the review I felt as if I am doing the test drive, it is so much into details. Also, the performance of DCT has been black and white now with such a comprehensive reviews. Kudos to the mods for investing so much efforts.

When I and my wife first looked at Hector, it was a love at first sight. However after seeing it few times more and also with multiple sightings on road, we are looking at it more objectively.

Well, a lot of such posts are surfacing of late. Which is why the mods on the groups are prompting posters to verify ownership. Otherwise, the posts need to be pulled down for negative publicity.

If it's really an issue, then it's not a good thing to happen to a new car. The clutch is hard but I don't see how taking the car out of the showroom can instantly burn a clutch plate or clutch bearing.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Before I went ahead and purchased a Harrier, I had been evaluating the Hector as the only other serious option. Seltos and Creta are a segment below and even my ex-car, the Duster 110 felt more spacious and not at all claustrophobic.

My 2 cents:

Pros:
The Hector definitely offers much more bang for the rupee when compared to the Harrier. Build quality is good and the Chinese Baujon 530 has a very solid 5-star CNCAP rating. Seats were comfortable for the short drives that we were offered, with only the under-thigh support seemed lesser when compared to the Harrier. The infotainment system worked well and the Infinity speakers were tuned beautifully. The diesel-engine was astonishingly quiet for its size. (I was looking to graduate from the Duster). The sales-people here and the ones who trained them deserve a shoutout. Knowledge levels about the car are good. They don't keep harping about superficial things like the ""air-purifier"". The sales-person allotted to me was apparently unwell and his colleague called me to inform that the bookings had opened. I cordially told him that I had already purchased a Tata Harrier. The original sales-person went out of his way to drop a congratulatory message.

Cons:
There were 4 Hectors in the showroom and all 4 had varying gaps on the bonnet. The gear of the car for the test drive was very jerky. I haven't read this feedback anywhere else, so it could be an exception. After-Sales service and cost of spares with the dealer selling a single car scares me. Volumes will drop in early 2020 when others bring in facelifts and new models.

My decision to purchase the Harrier over the Hector was based on two facts:
1) We found the Harrier to be a better ride for the highway where I spend 90% of my time. The Hector had a bit of a roll.
2) My running is at least 30,000 kms a year.

If I were primarily a city driver with low running, I might have considered the Hector over the Harrier as it is easier to drive within the city. Both are good cars and one should decide based on requirements and priorities.",,,,,,,

Thank you! Tata too now offers an optional 5 years warranty with the Harrier as ""Pentacare Warranty"". Mandatorily buy this if you do happen to purchase the Harrier. I had negotiated the same as a part of my purchase.

You'll see that often in ghats - with powerful high end cars from Compass right to the Volvos and the X6.
Reason? Drivers with less experience driving powerful torque monster diesel engines in heavy cars. The drivers tend to lug the engine, ride the clutch in higher engines as the engine ""seems"" to continue to pull. The laziness to downshift & perceived ability of the engine to pull in higher gear eventually burns the clutch out. And we see a premium car stationary with white smoke out of the bonnet on those inclines.",,,,,,,

The clutch burnouts are due to two reasons:

- The clutch return spring used on the first few batches of Harriers (and Compass too) was defective and wouldn't allow the clutch to return to position. This would lead to partial engagement and slipping that would wear the clutch plates without the driver even having his foot on the pedal

- the second reason as already stated is the driver. No matter how lag free a turbo diesel or any engine for that matter is deemed to be, being in the wrong gear at the wrong speed will lead to it vibrating and protesting. Some people just slip the clutch excessively and think they have found a solution to the problem when in reality they are just destroying the clutch. This gets amplified on ghats and inclines.",,,,,,,

Frankly, I think the body coloured cladding just amplifies the (dis) proportions of the car. The side profile looked weird enough before, but it's gotten even worse now.

It does look a lot cleaner and less busier, but I would much rather prefer black cladding to mask those bulky proportions to an extent. The 17 inchers look punier than ever.

Face looks smashing though. Wish they did something for the cheesy looking reflector on the tailgate.

It sure looks like they've fixed it. But it's entertainment so they'll have ensured that the lag doesn't show on the video.
But MG has updated the infotainment and it's faster than the test cars. And the best bit is that it can be updated. More features will be added soon.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"I test drove the Hector DCT for the 3rd time and there is one observation that I need some clarity on.

This happened 2 or 3 times during my 3 test drives. If from a standstill you have just built speed and you press the A pedal hard, the tacho pin just flies to 5.5k rpm within half a second without the car showing the proportionate increase in speed/torque. It even felt that the car just refused to move.

Also many times whenever I pressed the A pedal hard the rpm pin just flies to 4k+ range without building commensurate power.

Is it possible that the DCT gearbox takes time to switch gears and the car remains between gears for a fraction of a second more with power cut off than other DCT gearboxes or this is a normal behaviour in DCT gearbox. It did not happen in the DSG car that I test drove although wouldn’t want to compare this one to the DSG. Other cars that I tested were TC and CVT which did not have this behaviour.

For the long waiting period, your friend would have gotten some points based on what was told. Beyond the confirmed delivery date they give 1000 points per week which can be used to avail of accessories.",,,,,,,

I suggest raising the issue with MG with a screenshot of the news report where Mr Chaba states the same.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"The initial momentum of bookings has slowed down by a considerable margin.

Even though the imposition date of BS6 is nearing, MG is in no hurry to announce cutoff date for BS6 production. With thousands of fresh orders in phase 2, MG wouldn't want to scare people off and disrupt the momentum, which is evident from the fact that no matter which showroom in NCR I checked, none of them had the new pricelist. MG wanted to keep things low key w.r.t the new pricing so as to continue to look as a brilliant value proposition.

MG had claimed they had a backlog of 24000 bookings, this was after they said they had 8000 new bookings. Now that has gone up to 10,000. So 26000 odd bookings in all. So around 16000 bookings of June/ July still pending, majority DCT and Hybrid. It's safe to assume, not all the bookings will be met by March 2020 ( even if MG ramps up production to 4500 cars a month after the second shift stabilises, which is also a stage wise ramp up - different departments scale up differently. So around 3600 despatches in Oct. So maybe close to 4000 in November and taking it up closer to 4500 in Dec). So I'm sure a lot of people who booked now and get ready for the deliveries in April are going to have a price shocker.

And I guess most people who liked the car but have done the maths, have kept away. No one wants to wait 6 months for a car.

To add to that, MG is not going to absorb any more price hikes nor is it extending it's rewards points program beyond July bookings. So people who booked Sept onwards are already looking at a 50-70k hit. Post BS6, it'll be atleast a 70k-100k hike for the diesel variants, maybe half of that for petrol.

If MG doesn't ramp up production fast enough, it's going to leave a lot of prospective buyers dissatisfied. Not good for a new brand trying to settle in for the long haul.",,,,,,,

One thing this calculation misses is the cancellations, which I believe could be in the range of 30-40% of all bookings given the waiting period and some issues reported on the car.

I think out of the 26000 backlog, only about 15-18 k will ultimately wait for the car so most people who have booked currently can get their cars by Feb.",,,,,,,

Already taken into account. MG said they had 24000 bookings including the 8000 new ones. The statement was released around 10th of Oct. By then, MG had sold around 6000 cars.

Initial bookings - 28000 -Source
New bookings - 8000
Total - 36000
Claimed bookings on 10.10.19 - 24000
Delivered - 6000.
Approx cancellations - 6000

The second round of bookings has crossed 10000 now.

So if we deduct 3.5k of Oct, MG still has around 20k bookings to be delivered.

However, I've often seen manufacturers inflating their booking numbers.

As per my analysis:

The day the bookings were suspended, MG had claimed 21000 bookings - Source

However, as time progressed, somewhere between July and Sept, the 21000 bookings were projected as 28000 bookings.

Even if we assume that the number bump is due to priority waitlist, the numbers don't match.

The priority waitlist had increased to 20k by Sept end.

And the actual bookings in phase 2, which includes priority waitlist customers and new customers , was 8000 ( now 10000).

So, if the maths is redone,

Initial bookings - 21000
New bookings - 8000 ( now 10,000)

Total deliveries - 9780

Cancellations - 5000 Approx

Pending - 14000 - 15000 Approx

Of which 6-7k bookings are from Phase 1. Which is in line with what dealerships in Delhi are claiming.

By December, they are claiming almost all of the June/ July bookings will be cleared. In fact, a couple of them had 70-80 bookings left of the first round bookings, so mid dec they were hoping to start catering to September bookings. Which is also in line with the promises made to September customers that deliveries will commence Dec end onwards and will be completed by March , before BS6 deadline.",,,,,,,

I can confirm the same. People who had booked in June/July are being asked to cough up the new price, despite MG initially claiming that they'll be insulated from the price hike.

Apparently, MG has taken the decision to hike prices of all variants delivered post 20th November 2019, irrespective of whether the booking was done in Phase I or Phase II. The price hike is in the range of 2.5-3%.

If it's true, a pretty haphazard move by MG. Not ethical and certainly not confidence inspiring. All those who had booked in Phase I, despite being told that they'll be insulated from the price hike, will now have to pay the increased prices. This will certainly lead to a spate of cancellations.

All those who booked in Phase 2 were anyway paying the increased prices so they will be unaffected.

Update:

It seems dealers have been told to give customers an option of either buying accessories for the hiked amount or pay up. So basically, you're either straddled with accessories you may or may not want and are being forced to buy, or cough up the premium. Not going to win them any brownie points.

I wonder what was the reason behind the price hike? Secondly, it would be interesting to see just how many cancellations they get. My gut feeling would be that not many would cancel given what the car offers for the price and considering the competition is not that much better. Where would those cancelled bookings go instead?

This isn't another price hike. The prices were hiked in October itself, during initiation of Phase 2 bookings.

However, MG had promised that Phase I bookings were insulated from the Price Hike. Which is however not going to be the case from Nov 20, 2019.

Out of the 28000 bookings they had in Phase I, 6000 have already cancelled due to excessive delay in delivery.
I'm sure a lot more cancellations are around the corner due to the price hike. Diesel top end is close to 50k more expensive which is not a small amount by any means.

MG is being greedy here. They've delivered 11000 cars so around 11000 remain to be delivered ( Phase I). So they know even if 2000 odd cars are cancelled, they'll still be adding around Rs 30 crores more to their kitty. Unethical. Will definitely give them bad publicity.

Mind you, these buyers are already sitting on Rs 15/16000 worth of accessories owing to the points. Forcing them to buy a further Rs 40,000 worth of accessories is fleecing.",,,,,,,

Most DCT bookings would be from people looking at comfort rather than performance as Hector DCT is pretty average on performance. The Harrier TC could be a much better performer also given the better engine. Hyundai TCs are decent in terms of performance (Tucson). The diesel will be fuel efficient compared to the DCT Hector. So if Tata comes up with upgraded features like sunroof etc along with the auto in BS6, I dont see a reason how Hector could score higher other than looks which is a personal choice.",,,,,,,

Yes, mass majority of people prefer bling, feature comfort and a feel of big MPV over performance, drive and ride quality.

If you're buying a Rs 20 lakh SUV, mileage should be the least of your concerns. And expecting a good mileage from a heavy petrol SUV is wishful thinking. 8-10 Kmpl is what the DCT offers, and a similarly priced sedan would offer the same in the city.

An enthusiast like me was impressed with the Hector. It has its flaws for sure, but it offers so much more. I was very close to finalizing the Compass, before the Hector came along. A pretty able family car, that's where lies it's appeal. GTO himself enjoyed cruising on the highway with his family.

Contrary to what we believe, the masses are pretty well informed and the engine does figure in the buyers' checklist when finalizing on a car. Fiat powertrains are known and reliable. Which was probably the reason I too was fine with going for a new brand like MG.",,,,,,,

8-10 kpl maybe average. City driving conditions in a metro would be 5-6 kpl. In fact BHPian AGWagon did a very detailed tankful drive in Bumper to Bumper traffic on his typical office route and the measured mileage was 4.38 kpl on the Hector Petrol DCT.

I always keep the topic of one time purchase cost vs recurring cost different and so for me a Petrol DCT in that size is a no-no.

In any case, I was reading an AutoCarIndia article and saw that the Petrol to Diesel ratio on the Seltos is 49 : 51. So I guess there are more people like me around For reference: Autocar Article. Does anyone have the ratio for Hector?",,,,,,,

That seems a bit less. Two people I know who have the DCT report a mileage of 7 and 9 respectively. Tankful to tankful. The former is Delhi to gurgaon and return routine. MG road. Peak hour traffic. Althoughh the latter has a part of his daily drive going through a ridge road with sparse traffic.

With the DCT, care has to be taken to drive with a light foot to extract the maximum mileage.

7 kpl maybe achievable. The problem with city traffic driving is that it is very relative and varies a lot. So comparisons are difficult.

I am not a technical person, but this is what I felt why the Hector may be less efficient than comparable DCTs after 3 test drives. Because if you drive with a heavy foot there are many instances of no-power rpm surges. The car being is heavy and the engine has low power in the low rpm range. Hence what I felt is that there is a delay in slotting a gear if you floor the paddle, the rpm flies to 4-5k without a corresponding power surge. It feels like you have floored the pedal in neutral and the engine sounds like an unloaded mixer grinder (Yes, it does). If you try to drive with a light foot the rpm and power increases linearly and there is less rpm wastage. Hence I feel that with a light foot the car performance is much better with good mileage.

Having said that, I have read in Creta AT review that people are getting 6-7 kmpl in cities. Although it is a torque converter, if Creta is at 6-7, in a similar situation Hector would be 5-6.",,,,,,,

Correct. The showroom I know said that by dec end all Phase I bookings will be sorted and the ones pending will only be those where the buyer postponed delivery. Many people don't want to take delivery in Dec and delay delivery till the new year. Priority bookings will be serviced first and then October bookings.",,,,,,,

I don't think that matters. They have a sold book and a waiting period for next six months. October could have been higher, as many people would have preferred taking delivery during Diwali time. I hope MG reports retail sales, not dispatches.

I TDed, Hector twice, both Petrol AT and Diesel variant. Hector has a lot of noticeable body roll, especially on corners and does shakes your driving confidence a bit. The lower confidence is further accentuated by its light and twitchy steering at higher speed. Unfortunately, Hector doesn't have Electronic Roll-over Mitigation like that of Jeep Compass.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"I finally cancelled the booking of my Hector DCT reluctantly and with a heavy heart because I really loved the car. The looks, space and features are just fantastic.

But I was a bit concerned on the below behaviour of the petrol DCT that I had reported earlier.

It feels like you have floored the pedal in neutral and the engine sounds like an unloaded mixer grinder (Yes, it does)..
I tried to research what could cause this behaviour and a few youtube searches showed that clutch slip in DCT gearboxes have similar behaviour. I dont know whether it is clutch slip in the Hector, but if it is, it will really impact the long term reliability of the gearbox. Also I test drove many other automatic cars 2 DCT, 2-3 TCs and 1 CVT and none of them even had a hint of this behavior.

I was ok with the low mileage, but this doubt drove me towards the ultimate cancellation.

Also I tried to get the long term review of the Baojun 530 from China and used baidu in english which uses google translate and here are the findings:

1. Baojun 530 was launched in Feb18 with much fanfare and rave reviews. It was called the Baojun “God” car and a potential first Chinese global car(which it ultimately became)

2. The DCT gearbox used in the car was developed by SAIC using components and tech from BorgWarner. The DCT is named DCT360 and it is used in Baojun 560 and Baojun 730. It technically is capable of changing gears in 0.2 seconds.

3. User and critic reviews were mostly positive and the car sold huge numbers, more than 150k in 8 months.

4. In Oct 18 just 8 months into the launch SGMW introduced an update with a slightly updated engine with a new Turbocharger from Honeywell, the engine had increased torque 250 Nm compared to 230 earlier (India version is the older version with Mitsubishi turbo charger, however tuned for 250 Nm torque) . This engine was mated to a CVT (This version is being used in the Wuling Almaz and Chevrolet Captiva)

5. The new engine/gearbox was introduced as there were some issues reported in the DCT version regarding non linear and abrupt power delivery. The DCT production was apparently stopped in China since OCT 18, and only the remaining inventory was being sold.

6. The DCT versions of Baojun 560, 530 and 730 were recalled in June 2019. Issue was reported in ECU setting which impacted the clutch spring slider and it was rectified using ECU updates and change in clutch in some cases.

Given the above, I dont know why MG introduced the DCT version here and not the CVT like the other markets.",,,,,,,

MG does report retail sales. The light steering wheel is the only major gripe that I have with the Hector. Body roll is manageable, as expected from a large SUV, and driving doesn't get dangerous as the car gives in before it reaches it's limit. Bigger tyres will solve a bit of the problem as well.

As rkv_hunter posted, the lag in the DCT and the extremely poor mileage figures was what tipped the scales towards the diesel. There's a lot of reassurance that a proven engine provides.",,,,,,,

It's the other around, MG and its dealers should know that being a fresh entrant to the indian market, they dont have any claim to the real driving factor that sustains a car brand's sales after the initial wow factor - word of mouth (I-will-buy-this-car-since-my-dear-friend-guptaji-also-bought-and-he-is-a-smart-man).

On the contrary, that's actually an area where MG has excelled. The customer service is excellent, the marketing campaign is great and the brand narrative is on the right track.

Where MG lacks is product refinement, especially in the Petrol and specifically the Auto, which eventually will lead to ebbing interest. The diesel is a gem.

MG will hopefully look into the complaints and tweak the DCT for a better response. And give the Diesel an Auto please! Otherwise it'll start losing to competition.",,,,,,,

You need to look at it from both sides and hear both sides of the story. MG had told us that their approach would be to resolve all customer issues even if it meant a wear and tear part getting replaced under warranty.

There are many times when customers try to take advantage of situations and threaten the brand with unreasonable demands. For small issues ask for a new car etc.

The whole point of a warranty is if there is a premature failure in first 4 years or whatever duration, it is fixed by the company. No where does it say, new car is given.

The details in this case are not clear and till then I would not blame the owner or the Manufacturer till both sides are known.",,,,,,,

There have been no other complaints regarding the clutch getting burnt on the forum by any other owner. So it probably has to do with the driving style of this particular gentleman. A part can't fail thrice.

I'm sure the official MG reply was by an over zealous social media rep and the same will be modified.

MG does take it's customer service seriously. I was at a Delhi showroom last week enquiring about my booking and the SA was telling me that he'd been sent all the way to Meerut with a technician because a customer was facing connectivity issues with his phone. The culprit was eventually zeroed down to Vodafone having poor connectivity at the owner's residence due to which the iSmart app wasn't working.

And two of my colleagues at work have availed the iSmart road assistance facility, one for running out of fuel and the other for a flat tyre and they were assisted within an hour and half an hour respectively.",,,,,,,

Wooaaa.. that's scary! And a lesson, at least for me, to stay away from the brand.

Why would one want to sue its own customers? Customers come in all manners (colors, races, religion, pocket sizes, temperament, influence, etc.). Its a risk for any brand operating in any sector. Its how smart the brand is in managing such varied variety of customers that matters. Many brands, including reliable Toyota (for the Etios, in Kerala, where many people but banners on their cars for leaks), have faced customer backlash. This is the first time a brand is taking on its own customer, that I know of. And they make it public via a social media post. Extremely poorly thought out marketing move. It looks like marketing fatigue has set in at MG, making them make unforced errors.

Poor customer, put in lots of money, that too on a new entrant with zero history in India, faces issues (benefit of doubt to the customer here), and gets sued for adding to MG's revenue kit.

On a lighter note, anybody who ever travels on an MG, never speak bad about it. The on-board voice recognition system, will listen to it, identify the customer, and then sue him for driving around with people who said something bad about MG.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"^^ ""....as the customer continues to hamper the brand's highly held reputation.""

What reputation? They are forgetting that to some of us, they are just another Chinese company who bought an old British brand. To most Indians, they are a virtual unknown. Well, not an entirely unknown brand though, since we will now know them as the company that sues their customers.",,,,,,,
Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Certainly hope that they didn't sue the customer. It'll be a blot on the company's otherwise impressive marketing strategy.

According to unverified posts on the Facebook group, the customer was offered a replacement car but he wanted monetary compensation for his troubles which the dealer apparently refused.

Team-BHP,MG Hector,,"Curious to know from brand managers in the forum. If a customer is dissatisfied, do you sue him or console him?

I saw 2 videos of this customer and he clearly poses with a new car, and says that the company told him to not drive in the 2nd gear to preserve the clutch. I fail to understand this. And I failed to understand the members here who defend this explanation.

This car may have issues, like other cars. Sadly, the flop in China might not make a technically educated forum available for owners.

Also, some members are posting about roadside services being available within an hour. I may be ignorant, but even Maruti isn't so quick unless it is within the main areas of the city. It would be great if verification of actual accounts are included to help prospective buyers, since social media censoring is in full swing. Otherwise, the vested interest mentioned by MG might actually be true for another context.",,,,,,,

The problem of a burning smell has been reported by a few Hector diesel owners and a couple of them have got the clutch replaced. Strangely, it's got something to do with driving in the 2nd gear with half clutch for a longer duration.

The clutch burning issue has been reported on the compass as well. It's a known issue.

Not entirely true though. In some cases, the clutch design, materials, parts could be defective, fluid leakages, or there could be adjustment / calibration issue.

I had a torquey 2005 Hyundai Accent Viva CRDI, drove for 90K+ Km extensively through ghats, loaded and unloaded, not a single issue clutch plate burning, slipping, or shuddering ever in its life. Sold off the car last year. I also own 2011'XUV500, on which I had clutch issues (shuddering and/or slipping on up-slopes at random for a few days). Such issues also could have resulted more than normal heating of clutch but then I never allowed it to get burnt. Same driver, more or less same driving style, two different cars.

Mahindra did repair/replaced the clutch plate, pressure plate, DMFW under warranty. The original parts did not show signs of excessive wear or burning, but the clutch bearing or pressure plate may have sub-optimal design which resulted in either clutch not evenly engaging every time or having uneven pressure or bouncing resulting in shuddering.

Possible cause: Excessive deposits of clutch dust / caking on the bearing or shaft. See how the clutch release works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRIijFHb_4M



Mahindra always treated me well, took product feedback and each complaint well, tried to solve each reported issue, although they know there are some design flaws or limitations.

BTW, during TDs of Hector-D a couple of months back, I did feel its clutch to be 'hard'. Not just the pedal movement, but also the engaging mechanism (not smooth or linear, sudden engagement, sometimes stalling the car). I thought a new clutch plate would be slightly rough for a few thousand Km, or may not have optimal adjustments. Initial rough engagement may have made some drivers to adapt to driving 'half-clutch', eventually leading to premature wearing. (I am driving a 8 year old XUV500 and a year old Nexon-D, so you know where I come from)",,,,,,,

MG did make the effort to offer a refund or replacement to the customer once it was clear he wasn't satisfied with their product. So full marks for that. Their response however, lacked forward thinking.

You've been unnecessarily raking up the Tavera Scandal which happened 6 years ago. All the CEOs and MDs of GM India were sacked post that. The government report did specify corporate fraud but was satisfied with the parent company's response and no further action was taken. Karl Slym went on to become the MD of Tata Motors.

A customer, no matter what, is a customer, and it's an immature move by MG to pursue a case against him. I've given the same feedback to the MG folks I know in delhi and I'm sure others have to. Hopefully the company reconsiders it's decision and withdraws the same.",,,,,,,
