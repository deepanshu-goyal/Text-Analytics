Review
"Hector, as its name indicates bully's, its rivals because of its daring looks, starting from its front the massive LED headlights and the DRL's positioning gives it the aggressiveness, coming to its side profile it looks glorious but just the 17 inch alloy wheels somewhere take the thunder away, then coming to the back of the car, it looks attractive as well. If tacking about the features it is fully loaded with features such as massive 10 inch touch screen through which every function of car is controlled, its an internet-connected car, also the book closes automatically by pressing just 1 button, reverse parking camera is also included with sensors, the additional touch to the car is its massive panoramic sunroof which lets the interior to be brighter and feels more luxurious. Taking of space then Hector has humongous space which includes, the legroom, the headroom, shoulder room, etc. All feel large even the boot of hector is big enough. Coming to the engine on paper as seen it gives 179 bhp but due to some reasons, it doesn't feel that way. Also, the steering is not like an SUV kind and the all-touch functionality which is provided is somewhere inconvenient while driving physical buttons are handier than that."
"The car is full of updated techs and features. Apart from it, it has superb space, looks, power, and the driving experience is awesome. It's best in the segment."
MG Hector is one of the most popular SUV with advanced features with all safety features also with high built quality interior and exterior. You will get satisfied after buying the Hector no need to take any worry about we have purchased a good or a bad car. After experiencing the drive day by day you will be satisfied with your doubts.
A classic car in this range as it has a better look than Fortuner. Killer looks. Never seen a beast like this ever before.
"MG Hector is an awesome car because we are getting all the attractive features in the economical price range. So, I love to drive this car."
It's an amazing car. It's within the budget and the pickup is amazing. Amazing sunroof.
Really a lovely car and highly recommended.
" MG Hector has very good features and also get a comfortable ride. I love to drive this car as compared to another car. Moreover, this is the best car in this budget range."
MG Hector is an amazing car. Really comfortable and delivers wonderful mileage.
"As I shut the door of the Hector, the door's thud surprised me. It is a solid car. The acceleration was decent and the power delivery is great. The space in the back seat is amazing. The quality is top-notch as you expect from a 20+ lac car. The thing that annoyed me is the screen, it's laggy. The basic functions like the A.C. and the 360 camera seem to bother you to use. It's irritating in the long run. The virtual assistant works when it hears you and understands you. Everything is fine, but the infotainment feels like a beta and should be updated soon for a smoother experience. The worst part is, you don't have physical controls for the A.C."
"When we first experienced the Hector on the hills of Coimbatore, we knew it had the makings of a winner. No doubt, the distinctive design, exhaustive features list and a hugely spacious cabin are all strong factors in the success of an SUV, but that brief drive was just a sampler and didn't include the petrol-automatic variant. This variant is the pick of the lot, accounting for over 50 percent sales, and has a waiting period that can stretch to seven months. Hence, in this very exacting road test, we've tested all three powertrain variants to, once and for all, answer the torrent of questions flooding our inbox and to tell you just how good the Hector really is."
What a smooth and powerful car. Great looks and fuel-efficient. Value for money and highly recommended.
"Purchased petrol hybrid variant on Aug-19 and Completed 5,500Kms. There is nothing more I can add to its good points, mostly all were covered in other reviews. I would like to advise from my experience for Petrol variant that it does not have sufficient power for faster pickup and sporty drive. You should treat this beast gently to get better mileage. The worst city mileage I got was 8Km/L in the city and the best was 18Km/L on the highway with A.C.-Off and speed below 80Km/H."
"Fantastic car, great pick-up, comfortable seats. Controlling system is excellent, smooth to drive."
"Best in the segment. Better from the Fortuner and Endeavor. The voice control smart technology, I couldn't find it anywhere."
"The best car ever saw. Amazing driving experience and handling quality. The better interior can be made by making it airy, you can go for it if you have a family then go for it."
Best car and interior so far. Lovely design and quality are superb.
Superb interior and custom design. Awesomely running and very comfortable.
"This car is giving a lot of features, function, and comfort to the passengers. It has a true feel of an SUV."
It is better than Kia Seltos and the price is also good. The best car in the segment which gives you many features. If you want to open sunroof yon can simply say I am feeling hot or you can say anything to it.
"I drove MG Hector (Sharp) Petrol Hybrid for more than 1000kms. Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for drivers/passengers. HiTech features make you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Overall I am very happy. After driving it on different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""underpowered."" The fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways. Finally, I would like to say this car is a good value for money."
"Very nice design and stylish car. The interior of the hector is amazing and the touch screen is like a tab. The alloy wheel of the hector is beautiful, exterior and interiors too. The ground clearance of hector is ample. I like the interior options. The headlight was very nice and the backlight is also good. The boot space was so spacious. I like MG Hector so much."
MG Hector is a very experienced vehicle. It is made by Morris Garages (Mg) Hector. Its budget is very low and has advanced features. Its massive sunroof gives a pleasant feel to the cabin. Its touch screen is also controlled by voice. Its leg space is massive. Its price starts from 12.17 lakh. I really want to buy this car.
"Surely we can say it is a perfect fully loaded SUV model, well done by MG, Hector is stepping stone of our future cars."
"Read a few reviews where people alleged very low fuel efficiency. On a normal day in Delhi (route Noida Gurgaon at 9 AM) and (Gurgaon Noida 7 PM), my car has given an average of 12 kmpl. And while travelling bumper to bumper, it is 9-10kmpl."
"The perfect size car with the best class infotainment system and interiors. The tyres and the rims are eye-catchy and the front lights are alluring. The best car in its segment with appearance and power, with huge space, the car packs a good load and is great for trips and adventures. The company will get a huge advantage in the Indian market."
Can't comment over the engine quality because British cars are amazing in quality check. Build quality and features are also good.
"Excellent car in the world so far. It is best for long tours. Also, the logo of the car is impressive."
Very affordable range and super high-quality car. Very comfortable seating and quite silent. The A.C. system and circulation are pretty good.
"Nice features at less cost, It's helpful for everyone and it's featured as same as Jeep Compass."
"People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the mileage, Hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16kmpl. The dimensions of the car are humungous. In terms of comfort, the car can beat any of its rivals and is also prepared to compete with upper-class SUVs like Fortuner, Endeavour, etc. I recently went on a road trip in my hector and the ride quality was amazing, the suspensions were pretty soft providing a clean ride. Though the car is pretty huge, it is easily drivable in the city without any problem. I've heard it is also called the internet car due to the presence of a massive touch screen system with a pretty clear voice assistant. It manages to recognize the Indian accent as well. The pricing of the car is pretty neat and is the best car in the segment."
"Best and brilliant car by MG. If we compare the cars in Hector's price range Jeep compass is overprized, no premium features, and no comfort. Tata Harrier is fair and the interior is worst. The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying. I waited for mg was confused in hector and Creta but Hector was just better than Creta in terms of design, features, interior. So those people planning to buy hector buy the smart model because of it worth buying and I have also bought the smart one. Very Smooth SUV and with safety. A superior look with great Interior. When we talk about feature all upgrade and fully internet SUV."
"Got a chance to drive this car. I didn't expect that the petrol hybrid engine gives this type of power. This engine is really awesome. The 1.5 ltr hybrid engine gives a lot of power in the mid-range up-to 2000 rpm some amount of lag is there but it pulls up pretty quick. The safety features of this car are very good, 6 airbags, Abs, EBD, TC, Hill hold etc. The design of this car is awesome and the comfort is very good. The rear passenger gets a rear armrest, rear Ac vents and a good amount of space. The main attraction of this car is the internet Inside 10.4-inch huge touch screen. It's really awesome. The sound quality is also great. Pros:- 1. Value for money 2. Fully loaded, the features in this price are like Panoramic sunroof, 10-inch touch screen with android auto and apple car play with 5G sim support, electrically adjustable driver seat etc 3. Safety. Cons:- 1. The Breaking is okay, not that great."
Nice car and a strong body. The leather seats are average. Suspension and space are good here. there is no engine sound. Everything is perfect.
It was an amazing experience. I am very proud to own this car.
"MG HECTOR is one of the best and fully loaded SUV, which was provided at a lower cost in all variants. Ride quality and looks are also good. Comfortable seats, panoramic sunroof and AC performance are fabulous. Value for money."
"Best in the class segment! Highest cabin space in this segment with the best interior and exterior. If you are an SUV lover, then go for it."
This car's voice command system is really good and it's look is also good so I would give it a five-star rating.
Smooth drive and fantastic looks. Everything is amazing here in this car.
"Such a high rated and luxurious class segment car. It has great looks and great features. Fully automatic loaded features. High ground clearance, big boot space, electronically  adjustable seats and sensors I mostly like features in this car. Voice control feature giving amazing feel driving this car."
"People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of the electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the milage, hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16km/l. The dimensions of the car are humungous.

The pricing of the car is pretty neat and is the best car in the segment."
"It is the best car in India and in low price, we get a luxury car. We feel better inside the car and it goes smooth on the road. The interior design is too better than other cars and the interesting thing is the sunroof as is not single, it is double sunroof."
The car is good on cosmetics but I don't think that you can trust the engine for the long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to Indian road conditions. Giving a variety of features won't help if there is an issue in engine quality. The mileage is also very less and gives 7 KMPL on the highways.
MG Hector is the best mid-size SUV. It feels like luxury cars with the best automatic functions. This car is almost best in everything but its mileage is not too high.
This is a perfect SUV. This gives a real feel of SUV it is having so much space for your luggage and persons sitting in it. I think it is the best SUV in this price range. This car is having a nice sound system. I am having its petrol variant. MG also provides diesel variant.
"It is a nice car, it has a very good system, the interior design of the car is very good and comfortable, the speakers of this car are very good."
The best car at this budget including all the features and especially the Internet inside concept. This car includes a very nice experience.
This is the best car under 20 lacs with lots of features and it is better than other cars and the best car.
"MG Hector has the best engine and suspension. It has great pickup and an awesome music system. Overall, It is a value for money car."
"It is a complete package whether you are thriving for power or safety features, MG Hector has it all. The company has left no stones unturned when it comes to the body layout, it looks massive and beautiful at the same time. The interiors of the car are of premium quality and certainly makes the user feel true value for the money."
"It's an amazing car. I like it, it is awesome. The features and everything is good and it has good braking. The mileage is also good."
"Awesome car with excellent quality features, voice control, excellent looks like a beast and worth for money."
"I like spacious interior packed with features, refined engine and strong road presence. Fit and finish could be better and the infotainment system is a bit lacky. You just can't miss this car as its sheer size hits you before you even start focusing on the design detail."
"Nice car with good and heavy looks. It is better than other SUVs. It has nice interiors with best ground clearance and looks like a big SUV. I looked it for the first time and what a great SUV with great design, interiors, great fog lights and nice exteriors. It is the best SUV in 15 lacs."
I just love this car. Most advanced car in this price segment and one of the most luxurious car.
The car is very comfortable and looks are awesome. Worth for money and boot space is very comfortable. The 360-degree camera is also very useful and the sunroof is also very good.
"Best build quality in its segment, good cabin insulation from the outside world, less NVH level, cabin cooling capacity is quite good."
The performance is good. The sunroof is very nice. It is an internet car. AC condition is good in performance.
The car facility is cool and fantastic. It looks awesome and the tyres have a strong grip.
Nice car with all features of luxury cars. There is enough space. The price range is good in this segment. It is stylish.
"This is the best and only internet car available in India, all functions are operated by mobile app one touch plus the flexibility of seating system and ride comfortable control also nice both in city and highway for long journeys as its first car from Morrise garage its really commendable job from them."
"The length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. The 17-inch wheels also look a size too small. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention. The MG's cabin is simply cavernous and there is plenty of space for five passengers and their luggage. Range-topping versions get a massive panoramic sunroof that only adds to the airy feel in the interior. There are lots of other goodies onboard and the features really are a draw in their own right. The much talked about a 10.4-inch touchscreen that comes armed with connectivity tech is the focal point on the dashboard. Material quality is largely good but you will find some less special bits in the interior as well. The MG Hector Diesel is 170 HP, 2.0-liter engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, packs enough grunt and impresses with its linear power delivery and refinement. A snappy clutch remains a pain point of the Fiat-sourced engine though. The MG Hector Petrol gets a 143 HP, 1.5-liter turbocharged unit with a 6-speed manual as standard and a 48 V mild-hybrid setup as an option. The petrol hybrid is easy-going but lacks oomph for quick overtakes. The dual-clutch transmission does add convenience to the package but it's not the slickest of gearboxes. The ride quality is fairly good at town speeds, but up the pace, and you'll get a fair bit of body movement on undulating surfaces. The MG doesn't feel as well tied down as rivals at triple-digit speeds either and the noticeable body roll also means it simply isn't a driver's car. The steering isn't the most fearsome but it is light at low speeds and makes it easy to maneuver the large SUV."
"Beautiful car with great performance. Looks are great with a very huge cabin space like other cars. Very comfortable for front and rear passengers but disappointed with the mileage as it is only 5 - 7 KMPL, seriously. If you don't have issues with mileage this car is good and great. But don't waste your money on the hybrid model as in hybrid model they have put 48V lithium-ion battery under the driver seat, a rear passenger doesn't have enough and comfortable space for his/her legs."
"MG IS A WONDERFULL CAR. MG HAS BROKEN ALL RECORDS AGAINST TATA HARRIER HYUNDAI CRETA, AND XUV 500. THESE ALL CARS SALES ARE GOING DOWN DAY BY DAY. THE SALE OF HECTOR IS GROWING UP THATS GREAT EXCELLENT CAR I LOVE THIS CAR."
Excellent car. The price is the best. Comfortable drive and seating. Internet car. AC is the best. Safety car. Engine is smooth and the sound is smooth. I have driven this car. Ground clearance is best and height is better. Car facilities are best. Comfortable drive as compared to other cars.
Looking very classy and luxury. Leg space is pretty good. Very comfortable while driving.
"It is a very good car in my life I have ever seen so, brilliant work by MG company and also for the internet inside."
"The superb car, Drive is amazing and also that car has a voice commands so it gives very good feel when we drive. "
This car is overrated and doesn't match the hype it created. It doesn't have a good ride quality. 
MG Hector is the most luxurious car in the Indian market at the cheapest price. The showrooms of MG are very nice and the service of this car is quite good. Love you MG.
"MG HECTOR is one of the best and fully loaded SUVs, which was provided at a lower cost in all variants. Ride quality and looks also good. Comfortable seats, panoramic sunroof, inside the internet and AC performance fabulous and it is a very practical car. Mileage is also very good which we get in cities or on highways although you can say that this car is value for money."
"However MG Hector top model gets all the features that are awesome but in mid-model and basic model we can get very fewer features at that price but any way they gives a powerful engine and high body quality so overall, this vehicle is a nice vehicle but only one this company available only in Chennai in the whole Tamilnadu."
"This car is awesome with great features. I love this car and the looks of the car. The interior is very clean and attractive. Excellent performance, awesome, and a lovely car. I have a Honda City as well. But I sold that car because of the performance and bought Hector and I feel so glad and excited when I drive Hector."
Hector is a nice SUV. I have experienced a wonderful feeling by seating or driving this SUV car. It is a very comfortable car. I think that its speed is more than kia seltos. Its music system is also better than the other cars which is in Hector's range. I will recommend everyone to buy this wonderful SUV car.
"From the day I saw this beast MG Hector which catches my heart and soul, Since the first time I grabbed it in my hands I felt like this is it, its all I ever wanted. Really inside of the car and the exterior looks awesome and the comfort is just to a next level of imagination for Indians, its hello MG internet feature takes the car industry of medium segment to a different level. I really can't even choose among the colours options that it has which is unique among itself and with a unique metallic finish. Just recommend the people to try this out you would really love having it."
"Good mileage and best-running condition, power brakes, and best safety features and the body height is nice."
"Hector is a great car, best handling, and torque I have ever experienced. AIl functions work good and the car generates ultimate power."
"Good car, the look is beautiful, sunroof is good, the functions in the car are very good."
"Nice and best car ever. Nice features at a very affordable price, beautiful interior and classic exterior."
"Good Looking and best in the segment. The company is based in China and the UK basically. Talking about build quality & crash test rating, Let me tell you that, it got 5 stars in the China NCAP crash test. It offers many features at this price range. It Strongly competes with Tata Harier & KIA Seltos."
"The cabin of MG Hector wears a more functional design, but there are some interesting bits like the shapely digital instrument cluster and the unconventional gear lever, which add a smattering of flair. The large digital speedo is easy to read, but the tachometer isn't. As if to make the point that this is not a sporty car, the rev tacho bar graph is so small, you'll have to squint to read it."
"MG Hector has got best design and comfort, car is just a boom but smooth as butter, performance of engine is awesome, you will feel like you are sitting in a plane in business class, MG hector has all the feature of top-class car and very satisfying especially on Indian roads Hector performed very effectively, Ground clearance is best in class, And the best thing, I like its voice feature, hello MG it is just awesome."
"When we board into this vehicle MG Hector you will feel like you are sitting in a car which is too much of a premium car that costs 40 lakhs, though its a Chinese car it doesn't look like it, MG need to improve its service points at the earliest."
MG Hector is an amazing car. This is a stylish car. All the cars of MG are amazing. MG Hector is one of the best cars. No other car can be compared with this car. Interior and the features of the car are amazing. It is a luxurious car. It is my dream car. Middle-class family can afford this car.
"MG Hector is the best in the class car, awesome looks with great luxury feature especially the 360 view camera and the full sunroof. "
"MG Hector is a nice car, nice interior and all variant are superb, superb design, interior, safety system, the average is nice, good for the long route. A complete car, adequate seating for 4-5 persons, this is best for a small family."
"MG Hector is a superb car, best in power, you feel the real luxury in this car. Five stars for this lovely beast. It's a luxurious powerful vehicle. "
"MG Hector is an excellent car. Features are also excellent. Everything is good in this car, power, voice control, just like an Audi or BMW."
"Mg Hector feeling is like a luxurious car and a very costly car. Feels like Fortuner. Its ""hello mg"" feature helps a lot while driving."
MG Hector has got stunning looks and features makes it the best car and the lighting styling and sunroof add to the marvel.
"MG Hector is an amazing car It is as good as an Audi Q7 the most attractive is the technology in this car and for me the sunroof and moonroof. The car is spacious the trunk is also huge and the price is also not that high, features are also amazing also the logo of the car is very attractive and design also not to forget the headlights and the taillights, very powerful. Thankyou MG waiting for more cars from you all."
"MG hector one of the best competitor in SUV segment cars. IN MG hector all the feature are top class and very satisfying especially in Indian roads hector performed very effectively, Ground clearance is best in class."
"MG Hector has an eye-catching design, massive proportions and new-age tech make it a well-rounded package that should definitely be on the radar of prospective mid-size SUV owners. Though truly a rival for the Tata Harrier, Mahindra XUV500 and Jeep Compass in terms of its sheer size, keen pricing has also placed it precariously close to the likes of the Hyundai Creta."
"Done 2 months with MG Hector. Loved each moment I drove it. Somehow managed to get over 10 Kmpl avg after 2000km on Petrol DCT Automatic driving in Delhi NCR. If anything that could have been better, I wish suspensions were as good as those of Jeep Compass. Nevertheless, better suspensions than many others in the segment."
MG Hector is the best car in SUV because of its features and functions and its good look This is the car which hits and left all car behind by its selling point of view. I am a lover of this car too much.
"One of the best car in the market currently. Yes MG Hector is everything that a customer can wish for. It uses the best engines, it has the best infotainment, best speakers, best aesthetic looks, imposing front grille, biggest sunroof, largest boot, best AI, most comfortable seating and what not. You ask for a feature and its there. This also happens to be the most fuel-efficient car in the segment. But then again when you buy a car worth 19 Lakhs do you really look for efficiency? No, I don't think so. Had this car been anything german then it would probably have costed thrice the current price. This car is indeed a head-turner. You grab the attention of other cars on the road when you drive this massive beast. "
"Very stable and secure car from one of the leading SUV's MG Hector, Great design and interior implementation gives them an excellent look. Its 1965 cc engine creates a lightning power for an average of about 15-16 kmpl. Its a very good family pack for all those things and maintains an economic range. Go for it if you buy in this price segment without any obstruction."
"Dreaming a lot to buy a car and searching which to buy, finally seen MG Hector fallen in love with the car, the MG pick-up is awesome with 2 persons, slightly slow with 5 to 6 members and once the engine turned off on the road while driving, I got tension and found the problem is in the fuel change, overall superb car ever bought this is my first car purchase love you MG."
"The Hector looks the business, no two ways about it. The imposing hexagonal grille, the heavy chrome lining, and black detailing interspersed within the split LED headlamps, with their main units tucked into a recess, all make for a car that grabs your attention immediately, and holds on to it. For anyone wondering if these units are more prone to damage than more traditional lighting, the lamps on this car are very thoughtfully placed."
Hector has an exclusive price and the best quality. This is a very good feature car because this car has internet and voice command.
MG Hector is my dream car. It is a very good looking car. It has a beautiful look rather than others. Its interior is very beautiful and looks like a luxury car from the interior. It has also the best build quality. It is best for running on Indian roads. It's a very beautiful SUV car. It can defeat the craze of Scorpio as it has many features than Scorpio.
I bought the MG Hector Super Diesel MT after going through the specs and features. The fuel efficiency of the car is very good. The car is very spacious and comfortable for long journeys.
"It is an amazing experience with MG Hector and it's German-based company, powerful engine and mileage are good. Interior is designed in both metal and wood so good looking and main informing touching display is awesome and the voice commanding is enabled so easy to use this car and many colours are there. In the top, there is a sunroof And in front, headlamps are different than other cars its quad headlamps and LED DRL are there in this car and a big logo MG looks good overall it's a nice car."
"I have been driving MG Hector, Petrol, DCT Car for the last 3 months. I am thoroughly disappointed with fuel efficiency. City driving is between 5 to 6 km which is nowhere near the declared fuel efficiency of 13+ km. Highway driving FE is not more than 9kms. Moreover, there is a lag in DCT when you accelerate. VW TSI is the best in automatic transmission. MG Hector is not at all comfortable for city driving. It is too big a car."
"MG Hector is a good car with a new attractive design, nice work on the headlamps at the back. But even making simplest of the task such as adjusting the fan speed by use of the touch screen or voice command is quite difficult to get used to, moreover, the voice command is not responsive at all times. A nice new concept car overall."
"I have MG Hector diesel top-end variants. The car has a good level of comfort. However, it comes with a touch screen of 10 inch which feels good. The car comes with sunroof which gives it a luxury look. According to safety, it comes with 6 airbags, ABS, EBD, all-disc brakes, 360° camera, front parking sensors and many more. Overall I would like to give it 5 / 5 ratings."
"MG Hector is best in terms of space and it gets a tesla type touchscreen which is absolutely great. Its feature distribution is good in all its variant or its engine is good you can buy it if you want space in your car. But if you want features then you will go for seltos, it gets all led lights and best in bad roads."
"MG Hector is one of the best experience of driving this car. And especially in today's world where people are just in connection with one touch. This MG car is also now a smart car where people are smart with phones and many more. Well, it's one of the best launch for India to launch MG Hector. Drive your experience and now get a smart car."
This is an excellent car in the segment. The mileage is impressive. 
The features are impressive. The seating is very comfortable. The entertainment system is good. This is the best car in this segment.
"I own a petrol hybrid MG Hector and the experience has been amazing to date. Have completed 2k kms. 1. The engine : sufficient power for this sized car. I initially thought the power to weight ratio would be evident when it comes to pulling the car, but I haven't experienced lack of power in most scenarios. The noise and vibrations are so low that sometime you wouldn't even know if the car is switched ON. 2. Driveability : light steering & clutch plus smooth gear transmission, it's an amazing combination to have especially if you drive a lot in the city. On the highway the steering doesn't feel very light, so you have sufficient control over the vehicle. Around the corners there definitely is the trademark SUV crossover bodyroll. If you are sitting in the rear seat, then you can be assured that you are sitting in the most comfortable space which you wouldn't get in any car. 3. Fuel efficiency: 6th gear and 80-120kms is the sweet spot for this car. Put it in this range and ull set records with the mileage. Mine clocks 19-21 km/L in this range. Within city under heavy traffic conditions I get 7-9km/L. 4. Infotainment system: a lot have complained on the sluggishness of the system, and even I felt the system to be slow. The latest update has fixed this issue. The system is smoother now. With a USB connected you can view photos and videos as well. 5. Space and overall comfort: the hector scores a 11/10 over here.. 10/ 10 with the sunroof closed and 11 with an open sunroof. Overall this is an awesome car in this segment and should be an obvious pick for anyone who is looking out to by am SUV crossover between 15 to 23Lakhs on-road price."
"MG Hector is the best Suv To Buy With More Features. Pick up of the vehicle is excellent, Comfort of the vehicle is superb. The overall performance of the vehicle is awesome. Mileage is better as compared to other Suv. After-sales service is awesome as they have given me was excellent as they answered for my doubts after the delivery. Engine Performance of the vehicle is excellent."
"I like the front grill of MG Hector especially the DRLS alongwith the indicators. When I sat inside the hector it felt wow because the interior looks like you are sitting in a living room with a 10 inches display along with a navigation and GPRS. Voice command is also very great. I love the front of the car but at the back, it looks like an Audi as it has been given an Audi like finish. The second row is very spacious and it feels very airy due to its panoramic sunroof and its large windows can never make a person claustrophobic. It gives a tough comparison to Ford Endeavour and Toyota Fortuner. I hope that by early 2020 MG Hector 7-seater will be released and also the BS6 complain will also be launched. It's fun to drive the car. I am very happy to have one car if MG Hector."
"I don't really know about the performance of MG Hector and other ratings of this car but if you talk about the looks.. perfection.. its beauty is its LED headlights and taillights. Its slim body gives a very VIP look. It's gorgeous in every way, although its width is a little bit weird but the cuttings and edges are so perfect that it just covers the width problem. It's interior, my goodness can't explain it in words. So beautifully arranged.. furnished and polished. Buttons and A/C systems.. all perfect. Although the seats are a little bit uncomfortable for a tall person it can be managed.. It depends upon the people's adjusting. I ve heard so far that engine is even good.. in every single way excluding mileage but the acceleration and the adrenaline just couldnt be better."
Wow-what an experience I just purchased an MG Hector sharp mt it was an excellent experience giving a mileage of 18 and pickup of the car is very nice and the internal feature of the car is just wow easy to use and the car is giving the best luxury look which is plus point is that the car is very nice and this car is not much expensive and I will suggest to everyone to buy this car and have some great experience of luxury SUV
"MG Hector is the best combination for good looks, design and at a minimum prices ranges. This car have all the features which the imported car posses. It is a really good car at that budget."
"MG Hector is a good and powerful vehicle.As it has a powerful engine with great cc and power in a less amount of money. Just a remaining thing is an automatic variant, which is really needed."
MG Hector is an excellent car nice power and great comfort and just perfect for everything and the price is too reasonable.
"MG Hector is a very high technology car, And I love it and this car price is also less as compared to its feature and this car is having nice ground clearance and this car is fabulous."
"MG Hector is a brilliant car. MG Hector also knew as internet car is a car with a lot of features as well a big size than Kia seltos. Hector is a good family car according to me. So if anyone wants to buy a good family car, then MG hector is the best choice. "
"Bought MG Hector over compass because of its specifications,within my price range & it offers the same power as a compass. Cons -(small tyres, the suspension on the soft side so there is lack of high-speed stability) Pros -(looks, connectivity, steering setup it feels like driving a small car, huge moonroof ) fiat Multijet engine with good mid-range kick and sufficient mileage. Overall performance is great for debut year they came with a perfect price range and hence it's a bonus for us to own this human thing."
We Indians love SUV. MG Hector is one such product that feels strong and sturdy and huge like an SUV but drives like a car. Not an offroader at all but has a butch and strong on-road appeal like an SUV. Then with all those gizmos and airy cabin its just sheer pleasure to drive this beauty. And that ample boot space which could just help you out to move to your new house in a jiffy. Its a great car for the price point Would have been happier if they had an option for bigger wheels.
Best in class. MG Hector is far better from other SUV in this segment. It's very comfortable and doesn't make us tired at all. Went from Hyderabad to Tirupati a 14 hours drive was far comfortable with the family . I wanna rate it above 5 stars but no prob 5/5 is what it deserves. The MG Hector will rule the roads once all cars are out and people will go Gaga for it.
The MG Hector looks good and is tempting to buy as it offers a lot of great features at a significantly low price but the car has a severe problem which consumers may not come across very soon but some or the other day they may face many problems. The car's clutch plates are burning off.
"MG Hector is an amazing car which is loaded with full of features. The car has awesome looks, DCT(dual-clutch transmission) is very smooth. This car has amazing safety features and strong built quality. The only drawback is its mileage, it is giving 7-8 in city and 11-12 on highways."
"MG Hector is one of the best Vehicle, riding this vehicle made me feel of need for speed Most wanted. The big console makes riding more comfortable and convenient. That ""Hello MG"" feature just took up my heart. One from Starting to end, that touch panel, console, and each thing is worth buying. It's like Gem in a budget range."
MG Hector is the best selling car as it has reached about 21 thousand bookings in India and is India's first internet car. This is my favourite car as it consists of my favourite features like a sunroof and responds to my speaking. It is good as it has options of petrol and diesel and gives better mileage. It has a big boot space and is my favourite car in India.
M.G. had recently entered the Indian markets and became the most popular company in less time. The features are given in the MG Hector are the best features than any other cars according to price and type. It is having bold look and also having the sporty interiors. The concept of the panoramic sunroof is good and having the biggest touchscreen.
Took a test drive of MG Hector. The driving experience was ok. Actual AC controller is what a customer likes because voice command is not upto the mark. Camera clarity was awful. Seemed like a gimmick. Comfort level was good. But this car comes with offers which Indian customer loves. 
"MG Hector is a Premium Car. The finish, the performance all look top-notch. It has Revolutionized the future car concept and has set a benchmark of how cars should be. At a great price, one shares great Specifications. "
"I got my MG Hector Diesel Sharp on 1st August 2019 and I have driven for 2000 km. Overall car is great it has good road presence, pickup Is good, the turbo kicks in around 1500 rpm. I haven't experienced body roll as I have not cut any sharp corners yet. The screen is a bit slow. They need to improve the response time of the screen, also still waiting for the apple carplay update for the hector. In the city, it is giving a mileage of around 12-13 km/L and on the highway around 16-17 km/L. The sound system is great. Steering quality is not up to the mark, planning to get leather cover over it. Overall it's a good buy."
"MG Hector is a Revolution of the Indian car market true Combination of technology and Performance. I like the way car has been responds your Commands. This is truly impressive, I must say that is the Winner of the Segment. Everything got perfect exterior and interior both look good, especially interior good quality of material Used by MG. I must say it's a Classy Product of Indian car market."

"Drove the MG Hector one whole day. In traffic, highway and mud road. Great performance and smooth ride. Amazing features. Fully voice controlled. Even the windows. I was awestruck. The 10.1-inch touchscreen adds to the premium feel. The panoramic sunroof in the top version gives you a feel of riding a convertible. In short, worth every penny."
"Yes, I was the first to buy MG Hector in Coimbatore. it is a superb car with all the technology. It has an awesome voice control and it is also full safety features with all around airbags and it has a massive boot space. Usually German is good at technology but MG Hector has the best tech in the world best it has 5g support with wifi and it is a connected car which we can be lock and unlock and start with your smartphone itself.

MG Hector is the first car I had ever seen to talk like a human being. We wish we could accept more better from MG in future. This car made my day when I went for a ride with my brother. Since it is not a Premium car but it makes us feel more than premium.

MG will beat other its range SUV in the Indian Auto market.
"MG Hector : Just today came back from 1200 mns test drive of My MG Hector Sharp Diesel from 07 to 09 Sep 19. Driving comfort, Powerful climate control, music system, suspension, space, headlamps are really worth to own this vehicle but less wheelbase, lack of 4x4, lack of sub look are the drawbacks. Fuel consumption is ok but not matching with companies claimed one."
"MG Hector is a premium car with a great built quality. It gives good performance, it has good music system with a sunroof. The voice command feature is the first in the class."

Of course, how can I forget the tesla inspired 10.4 or 10.5-inch touchscreen display. Comes with great features. And 1 thing I would like to add is for me MG stands for (MY GAADI) HECTOR. 😊😊"

MG Hector when did advertisement from then only the car looked way to big and as its name its the human thing like everything can be controlled just by speaking the things like hello mg please open the sunroof and sunroof gets opened and also the car offers many other services and features that are basically the best thing in this price range overall the thing is that you can buy luxury feel in this price range.
" I am the biggest fan of MG Hector. Ok, now I will give you the proper review of this car. First, we have to go through the specifications (which mainly I liked ) *1956 cc engine *168 bhp *50+ connected features *25+ std safety features This is the specifications personally I liked more. Now we have to talk about, Pros :  *Design, *Full led lights, *Big infotainment system, *Boot space. Realy apart from these there are lots of good things are there Now I noticed some minor Cons :  *Quality of interior, *I think it may feel some uncomfortable for 6 feet person to site in the back seat. Other than this the MG Hector is awesome. The price and all other is super in this car . But one biggest question is arising in my mind, what about services and car accessories where we get this all. I think the price of the accessories of this is quite high because they have to import it from there country."
MG Hector is a very nice and budget car for many people. The specs and features the company is providing are very good.

"Actually just I am giving 5 🌟 to MG Hector because it actually deserves this. According to the asking price, this car is just awesome. Car is having internet and it is good looking thus States the car that it is one of the best cars of 2019. If MG will give this type of car in the future then surely the company will touch the sky and for this company, the sky is also not the limit."
MG Hector is super and features are superb specialist features are very good and this car made with human technology. It's India's first human technology car under 20lakhs and comfort of this car also very good and panoramic sunroof is very long and I can't ever see such a car with that excellent features I wish to buy this car for all.
MG Hector - Front grill helps this car to get an amazing road presence. Customize the interior of your car from mg as the Black interior is boring. The infotainment system is average but not best. Hector has awesome build quality. If you want to get a good buy in this segment you should go for hector. Mg hector is far better than Hyundai Creta.
"MG hector is totally amazing car, both look vise and feature vise. It has a voice command feature which is unique in its segment. secondly, MG hector does not have a hump in the legroom of rear seats. It also has the largest boot as compared to its rivals. Its more spacious and quality of material used in making the dashboard is really awesome."
MG Hector is a good car. Done something different from others. Value for money car. Best ever features. The best thing it's infotainment system. It's front grill and headlamps gives it a different and gorgeous look. Its seating comfort is also best in class. A perfect five-seater car. Alloys also give it an enhanced look. The built quality is also up to the mark.
"One of the best cars in today's generation, speechless features, ultimate look, excellent in speed and pick up, nice infrastructure, average, and mileage are quite good."
"It would be best if you name it as a china toy car. It has many problems, please no one buy the car and waste your money. The clutch plates will get burnt if you drive for more time in traffic, for diesel, there are fuel pump problems, All the parts are exported from China."
"Car and its features are superb, this car made with human technology and it's India's first human technology car under 20 lakhs and comfort of this car also very good. The panaromic sunroof is very long."
"MG Hector is an Amazing car, have no words but I can only say that from a bit time ago it becomes my dream car and I recently purchased it by knowing features, photos and dealers contact around me with the help of #CARDEKHO, Thanks, cardekho team, and great app keep helping people and fulfilling people's dream."
MG Hector is good for its internetwork but all people say that it is a Chinese company.
"MG Hector is an outstanding car as the car is offering almost everything like sunroof, speaker system, 10 inches touch screen infotainment system. The car has excellent interiors and exteriors. The car has some disadvantages as well, like small tyres and turbo lag. Otherwise, the car is excellent at a good price range."
MG Hector is an eyecatcher. We got MG on 9th of July. since days we are on top of cloud 9. its super amazing car with all luxury comfort style smartness n most imp internet-connected car.
MG Hector is the best car I have ever seen in my life. It is a voice control car. And it is at the lowest price is only 12 lakhs. And it looks very shiny and it has a sunroof. The sunroof makes us being the best view of nature. It has an awesome and stylish body. It also talks to us. 
"Actually, just I am giving 5 🌟 to MG Hector because it actually deserves this. According to the asking price, this car is just awesome. Car is having internet and it is good looking thus States the car that it is one of the best cars of 2019. If MG will give this type of car in the future then surely the company will touch the sky and for this company, sky is also not the limit."
MG Hector gives a good pick up. Looks are awesome. The best part is its sunroof and available at an affordable price 20Lakh. The competition is the Creta and the compass but it has an edge on it I think that the interior could have a more luxurious feel but if you are looking for a good package SUV + MUV you have my blessings go for it.
MG Hector is the best SUV in India. It has many good features. It gives the best driving experience. Very comfortable car.
"It is a human thing and has so many good features. It is a fully automatic car like we say that ""Hello MG, Please open sunroof, Please play my favorite song, Please turn on AC"" and it responds so well. "
MG Hector has good looks but I prefer MG ZS EV is my choice spacious cabin bigger than Creta and Kia seltos and in EV its better than Tata upcoming ev to buy.
I think  MG Hector need more time to set in India and Kia Seltos is best in comparison with it.
MG Hector is such a brilliant car because it has internet inside and gives premium quality. This car is very powerful. I like this car a lot.
 MG Hector is a good car but Kia has beaten it at price. No doubt features are endless the reflector beam at the back spoils the look. Though the handling is good and its voice control is a bit laggy. Interior is good but could be better. Exterior needs to be better. The engine is solid and the pickup is great mood work by MG for roads in India. Hope the best for you team mg India!
"MG Hector cant be the segment leader just because of low price and this car is not offering things up to the mark, as the car is offering low quality at low price and this is very disappointing. Either u raise ur standard quality and charge more money or must stop selling this cheap product."
"MG Hector is the best car I ever saw, best in feautures and best in driving expirience. The car is made in such a way that the person would buy it after driving it. Everyone has a dream for this fantastic car."
"  MG Hector is having poor quality interiors, bad ride quality such as body roll. Engine lacks a punch comparing the size of the car feels very underpowered, exteriors are good and eye-catchy"
MG Hector is the best SUV in the segment with fully loaded and excellent features. It gives smooth and comfortable driving. Go for it!
"MG Hector is a great car. I took the test drive and its a mind-blowing car and one of the most impressive feature in this car is voice command with 10.4"" infotainment system.    "
  MG Hector is a powerful car with best features. It has a powerful engine which gives the best experience.
This is an amazing machine. Full of power. In short its a beast. It is very comfortable and the petrol variant is so quiet from inside.
"It is really spacious, amazing handling on roads, good looks & affordable when compared to similar size vehicle. KIA Seltos is similar but there is no competition of Hector. Price for this is really competitive."
"Too good vehicle. The opposing market is perplexed and dumb, about what to comment. The quality, the material, the engine, the sunroof, the rear seat comfort is flawless. An affordable luxury."
"MG Hector gives good power and torque with modern features like wide touchscreen with the internet. Car is very spacious, comfortable to drive even in city traffic."
Touch response is not that good as compared to variants sold outside India and the interior is nice not the best and I did not like the design as it looks like a rectangular box as and it is not appealing as other competitors in the segment as well as the Kia Seltos which has made its debut in India. I think Seltos will gain more buyers than Hector.
"MG Hector, I just love this car as car design, interiors and exteriors are great. The best thing is voice control."
  MG Hector is an awesome car as it is India's first internet car. Car is having a large boot space and available at a different price range.
  MG Hector is a beautiful and comfortable car with same engine as of Jeep Compass and Harrier. Really happy with this car.
"MG Hector is a revolution in motor industry to come with this many features in this price like solid body, Fiat engine n excellent comfort drive."
Nice car with a good drive and handling. My children are liking it very much especially the sunroof color quality is excellent.
Disliked the car. Expectations were high but the car was not at all up to the mark. Poor build quality. Even a small hit had put a deep dent on it.
Disliked the car. Expectations were high but the car was not at all up-to-the-mark. Poor build quality. Even a small hit had put a deep dent on it.
A very bad car indeed. Not at all recommended. Poor quality and road presence. Not at all suitable for odd rising.
"My experience is amazing with MG Hector. The car is very spacious from inside, the cabin and the build quality is also strong. There are many first-in-segment and best-in-segment features like Bose speakers, Voice Control, Panoramic Sunroof, 10.4 Inch Touchscreen, Inbuilt Navigation and much more. I would strongly recommend this car to people who are willing to buy cars in 15- 20 lakh rupees range."
MG Hector's handling is not excellent and the steering feels a little disconnected form the road. The rest of the car has really good features like the connected asssitant and internet. The huge infotainment system really catches the attention. The seats are really comfortable. It is really spacious. The boot is big. But the engine is little underpowered.
"MG Hector is a very amazing car with seat capacity of 5 persons.It's back seat can also be converted into a bed.It is purely design on new technology. However, I like its voice assistant the most."
"The New MG Hector is the best feature loaded car under 20 lakh. The car provides the voice control,a huge 10 inch touchscreen display which is a great feature under 20 lakh. The car provides the great experience while driving. I shared my personal experience with Hector which is owned by my uncle. So if looking for a best mid size SUV go for the new MG Hector."
"Build quality and interior is quite good, the ride is also quite good. The music system is excellent. Car exterior looks premium. Latest technology used. Leather seat quality is very fine."
"MG Hector is a completely underpowered car, I have come across, trust me guys, I did a blunder looking at the features and not considered Harrier, a total waste of money."
MG Hector is the best car I have seen with great features. It's true that this car is just not a car it's a human thing. Interiors and exteriors of the car are great. No other is there in comparison with MG Hector.    
"MG Hector is a Good car and best SUV. Very Spacious. Perfect look and the best feeling. And the most amazing thing is a new style, fully voice command."
"The car gives you a very poor mileage. On the first full tank, I got a mileage of 6.5. km/ltr. That too driving at very nominal speed( less than 80km/ltr). I really had a bad experience"
"MG Hector is really a nice car, it has great looks and also it is a very powerful car. "
"Regret the day I decided to purchase MG Hector. It took two weeks after delivery of the car to get the documentation in order. However, the worse nightmare was to follow: 1. On highway driving, the mileage of the MG Hector (Petrol) is 8.76 (tank full to tank full)! This is shocking. 2. Air-conditioning is very poor. At L1 (coolest) setting and at an ambient temperature of fewer than 35 degrees, it was uncomfortable inside the car. 3. The pick-up is very poor. Even on a small slope, and at low gear (2 or 3), the car struggles to move. 4. Many of the so-called ""high tech"" features do not work. On the plus side, the vehicle is spacious and four (not five) persons can sit comfortably. I am sorry that credible websites like you and others did not bring out these obvious deficiencies when you reviewed this vehicle."
"Hello guys, if you want a great car in this price range, the go for the MG Hector. It has good performance, good control, good build, good functions and overall it's a beast... Its front design gives it a modern and futuristic look and this look is future proof so your car won't feel old ever after many years... It's very practical, it's huge display is awesome but it could have been more awesome if they added a 90-hertz refresh rate to it , but the current refresh rate is not overall bad and it's very satisfying... Its sunroof is the main thing which you won't get in any other cars in this price segment its dimensions are great... I love it... If you want a strong futuristic car that will get highlighted on the road, MG Hector is the one for you."
"So good car Internet directed features are so cool. The only feedback is, sunroof is not there, best in the class SUV, very comfortable, ground clearance is also very good, interiors are such awesome. Console tends to be very high at performance, lastly as the name suggests it behaves totally as hector talks in a bullying way."
MG Hector - Simply it has no competitor 1 star less coz each variant expensive by 30-40 thousand If they deduct their prices by 30-40k then these cars have no one comparators in their range.
"Owned MG Hector sharp diesel. Drove more than 2000 km in last 20 day. Awesome long drive SUV. SAFE, POWERFUL, COMFORTABLE and LATEST SUV. There are some issues but it is meant to rule Highways."
"If you are planning for a luxurious ride & value for money vehicle then this SUV is the best & beast of all. Against Toyota Fortuner, Tata Harrier, Renault Duster, Mahindra XUV 300, etc. Looks & comfort features including gives you a profound & deep satisfaction. The latest technology will give you a young generation feeling with all on a voice command feature. Leg space, boot space, another storages etc are all above the marks."
"This car is awesome as it is fully loaded with features with a voice assistant. The sunroof, audio and video player is simply great. The best car in this segment."
MG Hector is a good vehicle with less fuel consumption. The features are extraordinary.
It is a very nice car with high-level technology and great interior and exterior. It is the best car.
"MG Hector - Love the car fully loaded with features, looking awesome and the driving experience great with powerful performance."
This is the best SUV in this price range .i think if someone thinks about class and budget both at the same time then MG Hector is the only choice .their is no competition in the comfort and class felling in this price range in India right now. Internet connectivity and response time is also best.
"It's not just a car it's a feeling. Best car in the nation. Its looks, power, safety, braking, handling, and many more are superb. It never disappoints you on a long journey. Best in the class interior, features are just wow. Pricing is also very compatible with other cars in competition. Just love the car."
It is so exhilarating. I loved the car so much. The company has worked hard in designing. The features reminded me of Audi.
This is car looks awesome. I suggest it to somebody who wants to buy a car. The model of this car is beautiful with a wild look.
"The car is fully loaded with ample space in the front and back. The engine is efficient but car mileage is low at 8 KMPL, right now. The interiors are good, AC is very effective and onboard computers are amazing. Truly modern car at the best price."
MG Hector is amazing and loved by its performance and no doubt its best in this segment and a new feature is launched i.e the inbuilt internet in a car which smoothens the ride 😊
"Looks like MG Hector will disrupt the automotive segment in India. Still waiting for my car, but at this stage after observing all positive and negative reviews about the car, I still opine it is worth the wait. I hope MG will not disappoint its fan followers in this segment."
"MG Hector is in the waiting period. I loved the test drive and I am sure it a great car with a lot of features. I am eagerly waiting for it as I am a car lover and to my knowledge, this car gives you all the things that you would need in this modern country."
The Sunroof & the infotainment system of MG Hector is just a phenomenon and the technology in the car is simply awesome.
"I like internet connectivity in this car because if I'm away from the car I can start the engine without anyone's help from anywhere. This will be more helpful to those who are taking the diesel version, while the owner is away from the car for months they can start the engine from anywhere using the app."
"I just got the delivery of the car... I am very happy to have such a prime car at me. A worthy car only I can say. Huge Boot space. Very good suspension. Big screen and Very good stability control on turns. I also tested it for hill assistant and such good results... Although I haven't gone for off-road, I drive through a road of full patches and Mud and I found it as a Good offroader too."

The car is good overall but lags in power when used at its full limit. (7seats+luggage). It's little lighter than its rivals but also an economic one. Its presence is noteworthy but feels bulky sometimes.
MG Hector is really a stunning car specially in this segment. Everyone loves is design and interface. Voice command features are the center of attraction in this car. There will be more rivals to this car in the near future like Kia seltos and more.
"Hello, this is just a review after doing 4000 km on diesel top-end variant. I will not get into looks and interiors as so many people have written on it. I would just focus on my 4000 km travel experience. Did hill as well as national and state highway driving? Touched 170 km/h speed. Car is excellent to drive and braking at high-speed is fantastic. No vibration or sitting while breaking, just stops straight. On the bridge, joints do not jump or shake. Would rate it better than a Fortuner or Q5 which I have driven on some roads (Lucknow to Delhi). Hill driving did between Kanpur and shaktinagar. On hill, I find the car has less power especially when u change gears. The car has a perfect grip on hill turns. The car gave me an average fuel consumption of 18 between Kanpur and shaktinagar. Very comfortable seats just don't feel tired. Everything was perfect except for two issues. 1. headlights need improvement as on rainy night visibility gets bad. 2. Wiper blades need some improvement as it leaves some foggy impression on the glass for a second."
"This car is superb, terrific, awesome, best interior with Bluetooth, navigation, roof window, touch screen, ABS, airbags, radio, the exterior with alloy wheels and beautiful colours."
Very nice car MG Hector wonderful and safe travels and tours. It's Very good best maintenance packages.
The features are impressive. The acceleration is great within a good price range. The built quality is nice. 
Excellent looks with great mileage. fabulous design with a comfortable interior.
It is a luxury car which has fabulous features and comes with beautiful looks
"I took a test drive on the new nice looking car called MG. Yes, it's a good looking car and fully loaded with top features that the competitors do not have till I am writing this but, I expect that Hyundai will make the new car to make a tough competition for them. MG driving experience (diesel), I noticed the engine sound is a bit lower than the compass and the harrier. It gives good power. wheel spin is controlled, but I noticed one issue that space (gap) between the clutch pedal and the dead pedal is low its bit discomfort for the driver. the suspension is supreme but doesn't know the condition at corners. Music system (infinity) is supreme, but the white cloth-like cover for the sunroof has no quality. The wheel size could be better. the instrument cluster is not up to the mark. Other wise its a nice car waiting for a face lift of this model."
"Internet would be the ultimate version of MG Hector. The ultimate speak recognition that would understand everything on the car. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. In this generation, we want a car like this. Today People want an update. MG is a brilliant car. Because It is an Internet car..its the best one..."
"This car is really exciting because this all has all features which a luxury car not have, and it is very much comfortable for a family to go anywhere and we should carry many bags in his boot, and this is a really such one of first internet car."
"Loved the internet feature, aggressive look, comfortable seats, enough leg, space, and great pickup."
"Amazing SUV. Best in class features. Worth buy. 10, touch screen and design super."
"Hector is one best car in this world. The technology and system of this car are really very good and useful and as it said in the advertisements, its Human Car in this modern era. Look wise too it stands apart and my favorite is its electric sunroof which opens with the human voice. "
"This is the best car in this affordable price range. The build quality is nice. The pick up is amazing. The safety features are marvellous.
 "
"It is an excellent car with great specification, safety, and overall performance. The features of this car are great, I really loved it!"
"Best SUV, good boot space with internet connectivity. Thanks MG for introducing such a wonderful piece of your creation."
The best feature of this car is- 1- voice control 2- Big touch screen  3- Alloy Wheels
The first time when MG reveals it price from that time my aim was to buy tMG Hector! The exterior build quality is really solid. All metal panels have a really nice heft to them and they inspire a lot of confidence in the product. Paint quality is really really good!! But the car design was not so good but inside the car and it instantly scores on the perceived premium-feel. The layered dash with soft-touch leather. The infotainment system is slick and fast to respond but overall it is a value for money and I really satisfied with its performance!!
"Lo price but excellent SUV. Everyone needs an SUV who loves the car. MG Hector a Small SUV but it's 2.0 bs-6 diesel engine gives more power. It's Platform and interior design are so good and the sunroof of MG Hector, the outer design is excellent. The middle class who needs an SUV MG Hector comes to fulfill these dreams."
It is an excellent car with good features and it has a good capacity with brilliant features. The screen is the main reason to make this car an excellent piece.
It's amazing in its price range and of course the interior is best and amazing features enjoyed driving this beauty but all cars can't be so perfect its suspension should be more strong.
"Supercar, very powerfull, nice look, and great performance."
"Good design, upmarket SUV, intelligent features, Net savvy, impressive looks, dynamic and extraordinary Machine."
This car is more comfortable. It is a gorgeous model of Morris garage... Ground clearance is not as high as Fortuner.
I like the design and headlamps of MG Hector and it enhances its looks.
Good features but not good exteriors. It should be a bit of good quality
Nice car and comfortable space Power and interior are so good.
"MG Hector: Battery issue, small wheelbase as per car size, panoramic roof heats rear passenger seating too early. Touch screen not very responsive. The company's customer care not responsive regarding problems shared. Overall interested in selling numbers. New car delivered with scratches, driving foot Matt to pin broken, noisy roof opening & shaking rearview mirror. Complaint sent to the company via mail but nothing responded from dealer ends regarding the same. "
Perfect car to give tough competition to Tata Harrier and jeep compass. The car is fully loaded with features.
Middle seats seem not as comfortable as not getting support to thighs and maybe a painful journey for a long drive.
"Looking so stylish and a new generation SUV car today. and finally, I never have seen this car before."
I love the design of this car. This is the best SUV under this price range. I am in love with the features this car has.
Superb car with all new features. A pure mixture of art and power with an affordable price will make a huge change in the car industry.
This is a superb car. The features are excellent. Overall a good car in the segment. 
The looks are very good. The features are impressive. The handling is nice. The features are amazing. 
"It is the perfect family car in India under 20 lakhs, it comes with really great exterior and interior."
"It has excellent build, splendid features and best in class boot space and amenities make it the perfect in this range!"
"MG Hector is one of the best SUVs in this segment. MG has basically competition with harrier and compass. I had driven this SUV so I am sharing my experience. Pros: 1. SUV has a good pickup. 2. Smooth drive.  Cons:1. Issue with the voice command. Either the voice command did not respond or it will listen to your personal talk too. 2. Display touch: Touch is not that much responding as expected. one can say that Touch is the same as in Chinese mobile. 3. cooling issue: Rear seat passenger is going to face this issue in Hot weather. Rear vent cooling is not as per the expectations. Due to the sunroof, rear seats have a much higher temperature. 4. The biggest issue which the one will face is the battery issue. Even MG knows that its battery is not that much perfect that's why MG is giving a 1-year warranty on the battery."
Good SUV & value for money. MG is a good brand. Excellent SUV in the market.
It's a very nice car in this price and this is India's first internet car.
MG Hector is an amazing car. The looks are very nice. I like this car. 
I would definitely buy MG Hector and I have ordered too. The first internet car and the specially the sun roof. The best SUV right now in the market.
MG Hector is a very beautiful car especially the internet facility is really very good.
"MG Hector does not give you mileage, the problem of battery discharge is there, voice command is not good, and also rear AC gives you very poor cooling."
MG Hector is a futuristic car with a combination of technology and engineering. I can definitely recommend buyers to go for the fascinating SUV. Most importantly the price tag is very wonderful.
MG Hector is a fantastic car in the segment with nice colors and great features. It comes at good prices.
"It is the best car in India, you will get the best features in this car and especially the sensors as they are awesome."
Had been following this car since MGs entry in India. Got it booked way in advance and got the 1st Delivery of Petrol DCT SHARP last week. Car is top-loaded with Amazing Features which are all first in the segment. Right now getting a mileage of around 12 which is decent enough for Petrol Car of this size. Have actually noticed people on the road looking out of their Mercedes and Audis because of a Fresh and Beautifully Designed Machine on road after a long time in this Segment.
The MG Hector is the fulfilled Indian conditions. It's come on New features & its Unic. These made it Unic from other SUV in the Segment.
"MG Hector is a nice car. MG Hector have all the features especially the voice commands are pretty good but the only thing, I personally didn't like is the power and the acceleration. In terms of power it seems nice on the paper but for the price point Harrier is quite nice."
"MG Hector is the best car in India, It is the first internet connection car with SIM. It looks very good. The size, shape, and overview of the back and front are awesome. It has good leg-space, The price of this is also very good and for family, it is the best in the world."
"In India recently the new company had launched that is MG ( Morris garages ) & this company had also launched a new model which is the all-new MG hector, this car is the best SUV for India, Because this car gets more luxury features at less price & that's the advantage for customers, MG hector is the best rival for Hyundai creta, & I think the MG hector is best than the creta because MG hector is more stylish than the creta, & the main thing the customer see in a car is the mileage, & MG hector has the mileage of 15 KMPL in city & 17 KMPL on highway, so this wonderful thing in this car, & this car price starts from 12.18 lakhs, I wanna say thanks to the MG company for manufacturing this type of best SUV in less price."

Superb car with connectivity. It is an amazing car with excellent features.
"MG Hector is a huge hit in India. Booking numbers are over 15,000 units in about 15 days post launch. Waiting period in most cities has touched 7 months, and increasing. With production of Hector limited to just 2,000 units a month, it is going to be a long wait for most buyers. The good news is that deliveries have started, and are in full swing Just like the Hector, there is another SUV which is all set for India launch, that has managed to garner a similar kind of buzz; and that is the Kia Seltos. With all the details about Kia Seltos now available, it is time to take a look at both MG Hector and Kia Seltos specs on paper. MG Hector and Kia Seltos are both equipped with connected car technologies, come in with an array for first in segment features and brim over with driver and passenger conveniences and comforts. They are both well equipped in terms of safety and both receive powerful engine lineup. The MG Hector is officially launched in India whereas the Kia Seltos is slated for launch on 22nd August 2019. Despite their similarities, there are some vital differences which are detailed below; Exterior Design and Features ? MG Hector is offered in four trims ? Style, Super, Smart and Sharp and color schemes of Candy White, Aurora Silver, Glaze Red, Starry Black and Burgundy Red. It boasts of a tall stance and commanding road presence. It is fitted with a large front grille with extensive use of chrome in its makeup, all LED lamps at the front and rear and side indicators along with silver finished skid plates, 17? dual tone alloy wheels and squared wheel arches. The silver finished roof rails and large panoramic sunroof enhance its sporty appeal along with chrome elements at the rear and a chrome bar that is positioned above the license plate. Dimensions ? MG Hector boasts of larger dimensions as compared to the Kia Seltos even though both are compact SUVs. The Hector stands 4,655mm in length, 1,835mm in width and 1,760mm in height. It gets a wheelbase of 2,750mm. On the other hand, the Kia Seltos stands distinctively shorter in length at 4,315mm while width is at 1,800mm, height at 1,620mm and wheelbase at 2,610mm. These dimensions could mean that the cabin of the Seltos would be a bit cramped as compared to that seen on the Hector while boot space will also be more spacious in the Hector as compared to that of the Seltos. Interior Features, Safety and Technology ? Interiors of the MG Hector boast of a neat design. The seats are comfortable and well bolstered with contouring for better passenger comforts and done up in soft touch upholstery in contrasting leather. The 10.4? full HD touchscreen sees fewer buttons. There are piano black inserts seen on the central console with grey accents on the dashboard enhancing its premium appeal. Where safety is concerned, compliance to new safety norms bring in electronic stability program, hill assist, cruise control, powered seats and 360 degree camera, rear parking sensors, 6 airbags, ABS and EBD as standard. MG Hector is the first connected compact SUV to launch in India. It woos tech savvy buyers in India with its array of advanced in-car technologies for which the company has linked up with global tech partners such as like Microsoft, Adobe, SAP, Cisco, Nuance, Gaana, TomTom and Unlimit. This car also receives Internet Protocol version 6, making it 5G ready and the e-SIM is provided by Airtel and MG Motors offering internet connectivity for the complete warranty period. Kia Seltos also commands well designed interiors with comfortable seating, an 8 speaker sound system from Bose, a first in segment 10.25? touchscreen infotainment system and a 7? color TFT unit for the instrument console. There is a bounty of safety features offered on the Kia Seltos. These include ABS, EBD, ECS, 6 airbags, traction control, stability management, hill start assist, brake assist, front and rear parking cameras and a 360 degree camera for all round visibility. The occupant cell has been designed for maximum protection in the event of a crash with high steel and deformation zones to absorb impact. Kia calls its connected technology as UVO which can be accessed via a smartphone. It offers a total of 37 connectivity features with roadside assistance and SOS to alert a call center in the event of an emergency. Price ? MG Hector is priced between Rs.12.18 lakhs and Rs.16.88 lakhs. Kia has not yet disclosed pricing of the upcoming Seltos which could be offered in a much lower price bracket starting from as low as Rs.11 lakhs going up to Rs.16 lakhs for the top end variant."
"We are waiting for delivery, that car is my favorite choice with family, I'm getting feedback from viewers from good, while compared with other SUV cars much better than others ... So, we choose and love MG Hector."
The only thing disapointing is wheel size. It could be a bit big according to the body size. Performence is good but not that much while compare to same segment. Connectivity gives you a luxury feel in a small budget.
"I like the car design it features, it's awesome to see the front profile the dashing looks. the surrounding light system, it awesome to the led light, and there is no word for the infotainment system I will give 10 out of 10, It really wonderful. I wish to have this kind of car."
MG Hector is a perfect car lavish and comfortable and decent looks and luxury features.

I will recommend this one car MG hector and if we talk about the price of this car so it's good being an internet car."
"Value for money, good feel which gives inside the car, we feel the luxury needs in the car."
"I am planning to buy MG Hector diesel sharp variant. I think it is the best car in its segment with tons of features. It's slighting position looks superb with all LEDs. The panoramic sunroof looks good. I have dropped my idea to my Ford Endeavor. White color looks wow. The rear seat is adjustable with the different seating position. The ground clearance is ok. The engine with 2.0,  it produces 170 bhp. The decent turning radius of 5.2.boot space is 589 liter. Six airbags and 17 inches tyres and a Stepney with 17-inch tyre. Three spokes steering with height and reach adjustable. Rain-sensing viper's. Pressure and temperature monitoring system. Accua weather app and gaana app and many more."

"MG Hector is an amazing car with all the right features at an unbelievable price. The car makes an impact in the first glance and the interiors do the rest. Did a test drive of the petrol DCT as not interested in manual versions and the engine was on song. you can't tell it a 1.5-liter motor as the delivery is very smooth. I am driving a CRV auto and this guy puts it to shame. Did visit KIA to look at the Seltos and it sure is another winner but through sheer size and the panoramic sunroof, Hector leaves it behind."
This car is a very nice feature also the looking of this SUV is fantastic just like the luxury car I impress from this car because their features are the most innovatory.
MG Hector is the best car also getting all the attractive features in this car in this budget range.
"Seems to be right on Informant System, MG Hector has excellent features and design in this price range."
"MG Hector has a very powerful engine. Also, the looks and interior are great. There is no complain about Hector. It is a real SUV.

"The name Hector comes from Greek mythology. And MG Motor believes that its new SUV is that hero to win it much acclaim in India. Much has been said about the MG Hector already but now, we finally got to drive it in the lovely locales of hills and tea gardens in and around Coimbatore. It will be going up against rivals such as the Tata Harrier, Jeep Compass and Hyundai Tuscon. With the SUV market flourishing, it was smart thinking from MG to have an SUV as its first launch for India. And it is connected too."
"MG Hector gives the feeling of the luxurious car in this range, boot space and well-maintained cabin space and excellent mileage."
"Nice car I have ever seen in India. MG has a voice controller, internet, sunroof and a large amount of boot space."
"What makes the MG Hector a winner is its fantastic introductory price which ranges from Rs 12.18 lakh to Rs 16.88 lakh (ex-showroom, pan-India). MG has clearly put its money where its mouth is by giving a very appealing SUV that offers the maximum bang for your buck."
This is the best feature car in this segment but giving four-star ratings because the workshop is a big issue as this is a new company.
"The pricing of MG Hector is really aggressive and features like internet and 10.5"" infotainment and auto AC from your remote is awesome. The only concern for new buyers is the cost of service and fuel efficiency."
"It's Really High tech car in the lower segment...If this type of cars coming in the market then BMW, Audi is not having a good future for up to 35 lakhs price."
MG Hector is a very nice car. It is also known as Internet car.

"MG Hector is a perfect vehicle for us powerful smart and hybrid got attached to our soul this car thank you so much MG lots of love go ahead we all wish to come forward with your new upcoming vehicle and its a next-level car keep it up , and you are in the high level there is no other vehicles in this segment to compete with your vehicle we all are happy to see a perfect car for us after a long time once again thank you MG."
"What's it like on the outside? The Hector is certainly a head-turner and it drew quite an audience everywhere and every time we stopped for photos on the picturesque route from Coimbatore to Coonoor. The nose has lots of interesting detailing and follows the current trend where the headlight cluster is placed down at bumper level with the LED DRLs sitting above where the lights typically should be. The humongous grille, which you just can?t miss, feels a touch oversized, even on a car so big though. The blade-like DRLs further accentuate the size of the grille and look great when illuminated. There's a good dose of chrome, of course, used liberally around the grille, and C-shaped headlight housings. The prominent air intake in the lower bumper and massive skid plate look the part and give the Hector serious SUV credibility."
I would like a 4 star because of it a new company in India and until and unless this car is used for a year we are unable to know its weakness.
MG Hector is a family hybrid car with lots of features and voice command got excellent features.

It is a five-seater car, and it is very smooth for driving."
The driving is really nice. The engine is very smooth. It is a better option in comparison with other cars in the segment.

"MG Hector is what a fantastic car at the very aggressive price its 1st product of mg and it will kill tata harrier jeep compass etc. Amazing looks however spending 20 lakh to a new car company can be a risk, but otherwise, this is the best product and a very feature-rich car, even it's base model."
"It is made to be destructive in its segment. MG Hector loaded with tons of features draws the Indian customers to it. But real success depends on its reliability and aftersales services. However, steering feedback is quite disappointing. As of now, MG has made a game-changer with new technology to the Indian market at a low price."
"Nice V.I.P. car for the family such luxury car with every valuable feature such as audio controller, relaxing seat, nice tablet which make drive funny also help in long drive with nice define and texture only in 12,08000 rupees.

Awesome businesses strategy by mg hector competition with everyone in this segment but MG hectare is a very nice car with very nice new features which we get in bigger cars share its premium features in very low budget.

MG HEctor is an excellent car with good comfort and safety line car.

"Best car in 9 to 18 lakh and internet is inside in the car, also have 360 packing cameras and last is the space in the car."
MG Hector is the best car in this range with luxurious design. Really a smart car. The thing I like the most is the sunroof.
"A nice car for the family and for the long road trips but I would suggest MG to release a diesel automatic transmission option and it fully loaded with the features at the last, it is a value for money car."
This is a great car with great features. The feature in view is the infotantment system that is a 10.4 inch display with voice controls. It is a car with A.I.
"Best in class, nice looking, powerful engine, and attractive colours."
"Excellently superb SUV, built for those who are power, comfort and technology lover."
Excellent car. Amazing car features and a huge body structure.
This SUV's design is very muscular and features are very useful. The price is also very low.
"It's gonna destroy its competition, feature loaded. Many segment fist features. Good mileage. Good ride quality. Brilliant speaker system. 2 6ft people can sit easily with comfortably. But it's difficult to adjust 3 adults at the back seat as the car is not wide. 2 adults and a kid can sit easily. Overall a very good value for money car."

"I love this car, the functions, the looks, and everything is just awesome."
"It mostly looks like a premium car and will give you a luxurious feeling after sitting inside. It has all the new techs which will blow your mind. The only thing that is not good is the Tyre Size comparing to the car's size, and that doesn't look proportionate."
I love the looks of Hector and especially one of the most attractive features is the In-Built Internet Connectivity at such a low price.
The top model is the Best Luxury SUV at the best price to buy.
"MG Hector is a good car, the structures are unique and very comfortable when it comes to driving."
"Very good design, 80% of its features are good, available in four colours and prices are competitive."
Good car with a lot of plus points .. like internet.. voice recognition.. the new add ons on the exterior gives the excellent look... price of 14.5 is awesome for this car... Enjoy the car .. the only negative is fuel consumption.
Nice and excellent car to but nice new feature and amazing thing are that of 5 years unlimited kilometers warranty.
I like the new model MG. My dream MG car but I have no money please sir give me an offer I am middle class not 12 lakh 14 lakh only 10 lacs please sir give me offers sir.
Smarter and awesome car and new technology in India will appreciate.
Such a shame not to have automatic transmission. This is absolutely ridiculous waited for so long and no automatic transmission this is shabby.
"Highly anticipated Hector mow launched at a staggering price of 12.18 lakhs ex-showroom PAN India and it is super value for money and well suited for family kind of person. Hector has the biggest dimensions in its segment and really impresses on the space department. the boot is also the largest and ample for long picnics with the family. The engines are powerful, 2.0 diesel is very powerful and efficient and the 1.5-liter turbo petrol is also offered in DCT and 48v battery for efficiency and boost in power. The hector is very advanced in technology department as it comes with connected car technologies like geofencing and tomtom live maps and many more! The overall ride quality is awesome but it suffers on handling department because of massive dimensions and soft suspension but it doesn't matter a lot and not a deal breaker. On the reliabily front, the hector comes with a 5-year warranty and many schemes to attract customers. MG has also collaborated with Cardekho to improve customer satisfaction. Mg hector is really impressive and an overall great product."
"MG Hector is a great car with fantastic features and connectivity, the price of the car starts from 12.18 lakhs which is a great price with great comfort and good built but the only thing that is a pause here is that Morris Garages are doing there debut so we cannot tell how much the company is reliable."
It is such an amusing car with very good looks and class-leading features at a very cheap price It is better than hattier or compass.
"Goof power, best performance, the best pulling capacity. Best price and hybrid performance, also budget friendly for all."
"GOOD CAR IN SPACE, INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM, HEAD TURNING DESIGN, TURBOCHARGED ENGINE."
Just the functional system of the car is awesome. I just wanna have MG Hector because of premium look and features.
"The best at all the Segment but, need some noise destruction come inside the car. Only need that change."
Mg hector is the best car I have ever seen it is better than all the same price car and costly car.
MADE IN CHINA No service center nothing Why you need large display HARRIER is better than Hector.
It is an excellent car and worth the money with excellent features.
"MG Hector,it's the premium SUV not only in terms of road presence but in terms of all. For example even it's base variant is loaded with tons of safety features. Then just imagine about the top variant that's insane.Overall for less price a huge, spacious, feature loaded, safe rover."
"MG Hector is a perfect car for the young generation and safety features are also good but personaly I didn't like it from the rear and side profile. Other than that it is a good car and in comparison to harrier, interior built quality is also good. I would like to take a test drive to check its driving experience."
"LOVE, at First Sight, you feel the strength as soon as you touch the door Sturdy+Safe+Smooth+Super Mileage, Spontaneous Pickup, Super Comfort As of now, don't feel any regret for Service for 1 year"
Best in class Best personal driving experience New tech car Fully automatic New features Price satisfaction Too good best car in India in 2019.
"All new technology introduced in MG Hector car and it has more to express, superb driving experience and power composition makes it the king of the road, features are fully advanced."
Superb..design elegant concept..with voice aasistant..with sunroof..and LED concept is also good.
Very good car from a renowned company. I would definitely like more from the company.
"Nice car, it's good to know that mg is bringing new technology in the form of Android, and by doing this it brings our car close to us."
MG Hector is the best in class and the AI will increase the user interface.
This is a good car. The looks are awesome. It is worth the value. 
This was an amusing car and the features are so excellent newly introduced in this car like magic. I never seen before such wonderful things and the boot space is very huge sunroof also profiles the rich SUV better than other SUV's back side space is very large driver seats are also comfortable automatically voice command is a new magician.
"Aged so well, with fantastic road presence still, just adequate proportions accommodating 7 seats and all the bells and whistles, I doubt any other mid-sized SUV can beat XUV5OO. As the initial fuzz dies just as in case of Jeep Compass, and the Chinese quality begins crying hoarse, XUV would still rule the roost."
"Love the looks, love the features of MG Hector. The most attractive feature of the car is the voice command and the big screen. Great looks, advanced technology, and a muscular car at a reasonable cost. People searching for a big car with luxurious looks, in the budget then this is the one. I loved the car very much."
"MG Hector : Great features, Spacious, muscular and a luxurious car at a reasonable cost. Voice command and a large Display are the most attractive part. Surely MG Hector will beat other cars in the same segment. Bigger size, advanced features, great look, reasonable price are the reasons which make it a must buy."
Beautiful and a must buy the car. All in one. The car has all the latest features with style and bold looks. Must buy for an SUV lover.
Good technology to adopt the car and good look. Car safety will be the same as the Volvo cars.
I love to have this car with a great specification and very friendly and up to the mark of modern technology.

The car design is awesome and modern and the feature that offers just mind-blowing but some safety feature not available overall the car is just perfect at price.
It is a very luxurious car in its segment anyone can buy it its ex-showroom price is 13 lakh rs in India
"This car looks like a robot, and it has a human thing.  This car is best for families."
A complete class. What an amazing introductory price to start with.

Awesome car with the best pricing which may rule Indian roads! Voice commands are just so fab!
Screen size and voice over command features are excellent.. it is going to rule SUV market.
It has good and stunning design at front. It looks aesthetic. But the concern is with the size of the wheel. They have to improve it with a bigger size alloy wheel.
Very awesome best in its segment worth buying with great all goodies.
"Worth the price, the company is outfield with the features they are providing, and the looks are incredible."
"The most impressive feature is its large touch screen, which makes it special from others. But its price is a bit expensive."

MG Hector is a great car with all the necessary features loaded in it.
"MG Hector is a very nice car for a small family, and one of the best features getting in this car."
"This car has all the thing that you want and the best part is human voice recognition and internet linked. this car has the highest power in its segment and it also left Scorpio behind in power. You can get a little disappointed by the less no. Of physical button, although you have to set the AC speed with the screen."
"MG Hector is a nice looking car, the feature is also good, and a new looking design."
"The overall outside look is very nice, but the interior is very simple need to work on the interior."
Car manufactured by a Chinese company. Safety and quality cannot be trusted. The resale value of the car may be low.
"MG cars, Nice look and smart.  Waiting for it. new car new segment new hope for a car lover."

Two things are missing. driving pleasure can be improved and ventilated seats are enquired.
The Worst experience in test drive Diesel version I think it's worthless in waiting for this Hector engine performance. It is not as expected poor performance and engine better to go with jeep or Harrier.
This is a nice car. The driving is very smooth. The looks are really good. 
"It is a very good looking car. I felt the plastic quality inside was poor. The headlights were on the bumpers at the bottom is going to be an expensive affair in India. In this traffic, one is always banging their bumpers."
"MG Hector is the best SUV in this price range, the car design is fantastic, so I am very excited about this car."
"Totally loved this car in this range, this car has a lot of features that no other car company can give in this price range."

Excellent looking car with great interiors. A lot of smart features make this car a worth buy at this price point. Well done MG.
"It's a perfect car. It listens to the voice and does whatever is said to do, nice technology."
"MG Hector is looking awesome! But back side silver bumper looks very poor. Back side silver bumper ki vajah se gadi bethi huyi lagti he jese gadi overload ja Rahi he eesa dikhta he, Back side silver bumper achha ho Sakta tha bhai, jo aapki other countries me he Vesa lagaya hota to achha back side look dikhta ."
"If this Car is available in 7 Seater Variant, then the sale would preferably be good in Market, Yeh gaadi, Toyota Innova Crysta aur Fortuner jaise model ko compete kar sakta hai."
I am using MG 350 car(Saudi Arabia)...This company is best than other company...good mileage...smooth driving...I will buy this MG Hector in India when i come...My friend test drive and told its a awesome car...Gonna be the top car of the year.

"Very good space, powerful engine, steering is very smooth, overall, the vehicle is good."
"Best SUV car up till now. With sunroof and many exciting features, it seems very attractive and dashing. Its looks are huge from other cars."
Wonderful shape of the MG Hector. Looks very strong and heavy thats what I personally like about this car. The front grill is superb and can say that this makes the car more attractive. Side lines superb. Looks very spacious. But the interior does not match that much according to the outer body .other wise interior is very well but only about the dashboard looks little less attractive than the body. Looking to the engine looks good according to the power torque and other features. 4.5 star for the body shape 3 star for the interior

"This is feature loaded car gives you the best experience in everything must buy this car The MG Hector definitely offers more than what we had expected of it. It is rich on features, has decent engine options and offers Likeable performance too. Plus, the quality is good too. The big USP is the connectivity technology that it offers and while the excitement may wear off after some time, it definitely features in the consideration set when customers set out to make a purchase in this segment."
Race of the MG Hector is absolutely amazing in this segment but the only negative point is the acceleration for city driving it actually boost after 2000 RPM that is really annoying.
"Strong feel, tougher stance, inherent royal build, solid styling, good ground clearance, stylish wheel arches and tyres, new gen features, luxurious, spacious, comfortable reclinable back seats, right thigh support, thoughtful storage spaces, huge boot space, own the road looks, definitely an investment worth travelling in."
"MG Hector is a very beautiful car and with strong and solid build quality. The base model itself provided with all safety features. The entertainment system, i-smart are too good with all the latest smart technology. Waiting for the official price and expecting the same to be very competitive against Harrier and Jeep."

"MG Hector is an awesome car, huge screen with a large instrument cluster, largest panoramic sunroof, electric seats, humongous boot space and a lot more with a 48v hybrid ,all the things in hector is very appreciable as it also comes with reclining seats ,dct(dual-clutch transmission)and a front grill that gives it a appealing look with a mg batching on it .."

"The best combination of harrior, Tuscon, jeep compose, and the best and the cheapest hybrid car ever in India .the internet car.and its turbo engine and this will be a game changer. From outside SUV and interior is like Tesla. Hector comes in 3 forms sharp, smart, super. the choice is yours. Which is best for you."
Good looking very nice and very smooth car and space and technology good personality car. I am impressed with your car.
I like the overall car interior and exterior design.
"Dear all, rating this car at 5 stars is just through brainstorming and comparing with one I intend to buy in the last 1 months have taken test drive for all except MG, standing in comparison will be XUV500 W11option, Jeep Compass, hairier, T crysta, Skoda Superb, Civic, CRV both petrol n diesel. Alturas. I say MG yes, infotainment screen, front design, wheelbase, ground clearance(192) other in this segment are high 190-210mm,but yes front cluster, digital speedo, quality of plastics and inside cabin material, automatic seat and co-driver also, with thigh support, excellent voice command, remote controls, remote car view etc are great luxury features, yes the tag or MG looks great, overall I am now going for it with just a small price of 22-23 lakhs on road price for diesel variant. Only negative may be if service and car resale value flop! but still you will have head tilted once you are on road, I m sure!"
MG Hector petrol version is highly-priced for 1.5-litre engines. I think they should relook on pricing to position petrol version in the Indian market else be ready for the super flop and it will be worst than jeep compass petrol version. Even offering higher discounts also you will not be able to attract customers. So-called outstanding features are available only in the top end. MG will be the biggest fool by Dec 2019.
"MG's best car in India. It has more than 50 connected features and it's a first class segment. Also, its given colors are too awesome. Its whole interior is very spacious and attractive. Nicely presented everything and seats covered with leather and also an HD infotainment touch screen. Also provided nice parking cameras which are all good. To say in one line its full of features and value for money."
This is a great car. The looks are very impressive. 
"Ppl expect its making quality is equal to Jeep, cheaper than jeep but still mg as not revealed price, just they started booking because. MG is thinking over smart like if bookings are so good they keep options to hike the price, customers also so smart."
"It is Good Inside and Outside but the Price would be the drawback. When an SUV at High-end variant is available at the same price range and better features, why would a Customer prefer this?"
"EXCELLENT CAR OF THE WORLD, IN INDIAN ROAD CONDITION -IT IS THE BEST ONE ON THIS PRICE RANGE AND IT MUST FIGHT WITH TOYOTA AND HONDA AND HYUNDAI MARKET."
"Best car in this price, full features package and looking as true SUV. The full average is awesome.t this is my dream car, thank MG."
Amazing Car with Stylish looks and looks a perfect business car available at an affordable price range.
the first ever car to defeat jeep compact has a good look and powerful engine with best features. I am sure to buy it.
"By looking at the specifications and features, MG Hector seems to be a strong contender in its segment. It excels in every department be it engine, features, design, space. It comes with many segment-first features like an internet-based vertically mounted 10.4 inches infotainment system, a full panoramic sunroof, connected car features, etc that make it more appealing to the Indian consumer. Apart from features, MG Hector is also very well equipped in terms of safety. Safety features like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, traction control, all four disc brakes, hill hold assist, and ISOFIX child seat mounts are stand across the range. Only if MG can price the Hector aggressively, somewhere between 15-20 Lakh then I think it will be a value for money option for buyers in the segment. As MG is a new brand in the Indian automotive market, it will be interesting to see how MG handles the sale and service of its vehicles. To me, MG Hector seems to be a solid competitor to other vehicles in its segment. It seems to be a sensible choice for someone who is looking to buy a well built and feature-rich SUV under 20 Lakhs. Only time will tell how well the MG brand performs in the Indian automotive market."
"Superb looking marvelous beauty with a beast Engine. Will rock Indian car market. Extraordinary features that surprise. Beautiful Front design with superb headlight. Rear design is really Sex and great. Panoramic Sunroof looks deadly in the pictures, I'm definitely sure it will be a breath shocking the moment I get to see the car with my eyes. Interior are excellent.if prices would be kept in competitive range. This car would rule the sun segment. Congrats to MG Hector team. Great work done. Welcome to India and wish all the best."
MG Hector is a wonderful car in this model. Also in this price range getting a good option. The tail lights are the luxurious look and the additional sunroof is providing the energy to interior spaces of car. The diesel engine is providing extreme performance to the car like a beast. It would be my dream car.
"I had a chance to look at this car in the UK and trust me it?s nothing more than a Chinese car with British badge. From the side, it looks very odd and out of shape especially with its tyres which looks disproportionate. It actually looks like an ugly brother of MPV fused with SUV when seen in person. Spending around 15-20 lakhs for a Chinese car with no proven credentials is not something I am keen on."
It has Good Safety features. E connect is definitely a USP for this car. It will redefine the SUV segment for Indians. The MG Hector comes with lots of features which are 1st in the SUV segment. MG Hector is able to get a lot of attention due to its innovative features. This SUV definitely looks value for money.

"In this price MG Hector is wonderful, features are excellent, hill hold, 360-degree camera view sunroof and many more it would be my dream car."
"To be honest I am reviewing the first time for any car. The best thing about this car is that it is future ready. No need to get upset about technical advancement. In fact, without seeing it or driving it I am already in love with this car. The looks are so mesmerizing that now it become my dream to own this car. In one word Supreme leader in your segment."
MG Hector is a wonderful car in this model. Also in this price range getting a good option. A perfect car in terms of comfort which getting in this car. Good SUV in this range.
It's truly more than a Human Thing. It would be a trend setter for the modern SUVs and lead from the front. It's been a dream to have such a car. MG Hector is The Smartest of its segment where it shows that even machines need to be sensitive and understand the needs. Hector is sure to build relations for generations.
I like I want to buy that I like for the first time in advertisement my parents told that to by this car.
"Features and stylish elegant in look, price should be thought of. That is competing then the car leaches its peaks."
Hector is just the best .coming with such advanced techno features that no.other is offering.
Great car. We're very happy for MG  cars come in India. MG make a milestone in India.
MG hector is going to be the best car under 20lk and the best family tour car too.
"MG Hector will be the best car in future and at the cheapest price ever. If you tell the voice assistant to open the door, immediately it will open the door. You can also open sunroof by Using voice assist. You can also remote control it using MG app. For example, you can slow down the AC power or you can of it. The interior and exterior are very good."
A very amazing car when it comes to looks both the interior and the exterior looks. This company has come out with its first car MG HECTOR in India has a variety of such features which other cars don't have Looking at all the features it is quite cheap at the price at which it is available The mileage is also good as it provides a mileage of 17-19kmpl It has a seating capacity of 5people The backspace is also very good and a good amount of baggage can be kept Has a nice music system fit In it so nice sound quality can be enjoyed The seats are also comfortable The rear windows don't open fully so that is a problem which some of us may take as Drivers system can be adjusted electronically Huge amount of lights?s available in the car.
It is a sporty car. The looks are very stylish. I am impressed with the engineering. 
excellent view of mg hector overall car designed in the way that anybody shall be like in the first view. cost of the mg hector is also companionable to other SUVs. I think the company is giving a big opportunity to the public feel luxurious in the low cost.4to5 person will easily sit with comfort n take the luxurious journey.
Best sports utility vehicle under this price segments it has an engine which is best in torque the best sound with four speakers and two twisters. This car has best safety feature such as six airbags it has electronic brake distribution and anti-lock brake distribution it has disk break on four tires of has ten inches full Hd display as a stereo system.
I found Hector to be a game changer in the Indian market in the economy SUV segment especially being the first smart car. A strong road presence and classy interiors are certainly the best compared to Jeep Compass and Harrier. Really looking forward to seeing one on the road soon.
This is the best car. The looks are amazing. 
"The model details itself captured my mind. If i plan to buy a new vehicle my first preference will definitely these one itself, in no other vehicles, i have seen this many features, not only that this vehicle gives more care for safety as well. I am very excited for a great launch of my dream vehicle."
So nice Car India's First E-sim car. His Assistant is So Responsible. You should buy this Car.This car contains very good specs
"Awesome car by MG, hope that they will bring better options in their next cars."
This will smash the Indian car market. I will definitely choose it. It's worthy for its estimated cost. Loved it. If we look at the features no more cars having 15-20 lakhs rupees may not provide such astonishing features. Eager to see this cheetah. If we modify further it will become unstoppable car ever in India.
I found Hector the best in the segment. I appreciate the price in this category with exclusive features. I am really eager to take test drive of Hector. I am sure the test drive will double my likes for Hector. This is the first car I have seen where I stop thinking for other cars. There is not a single doubt on the performance. Obviously test drive is the add-on feature.
"The pricing on the petrol version is way too high for the 1.5-litre engine. In that case, it will perform worst than jeep petrol version in buyer sensitive market. If the claimed features not available in petrol version then MG forgets about Indian customers for your petrol version. Good luck with your diesel version. XUV 500 and Harrier will still lead."
So nice best model the best interior they decided supermodel this is best and no 1 SUV and I love this car and hands off to the excellent brain who had designed this car. They designed boot space very well. It designed very comfortable for people so all love this car. It was designed with smart and hybrid technology.
Best mid-size SUV and having every advanced stuff .. It will be above all competitors?.. Will also compete Innova crysta
The petrol version is overpriced. MG will be in the worst position compared to the jeep petrol version which is again overpriced for the 1.5-litre segment. If the claimed features not available in the petrol version then it will be difficult for MG  Good luck with Diesel version. XUV 500 and Tata Harrier will still lead the market.
Best in this segment. Best in Features. Best in Price. Best in Look. Best in Everything. Best way to get an entry in India.
"Good car, fabulous model, Fantastic interiors, and unbelievable SUV."
It's very nice waiting for the launch when compared the look is simply superb. It is almost competitor with Fortuner
MG Hector is the best car in this segment with the best technology and material.
"MG Hector is beautifully designed with a lot of space and segment first features. The Petrol Engine fills the gap between 1200-1600cc and comes with an auto gearbox too. Interiors are beautifully done. The outer looks are to die for. The connected 10.4-inch screen is a big plus for feature lovers. In India, for most people, 15 lakhs is a sort of mental barrier. The Creta is overpriced by a lot for a lot fewer features. The Harrier doesn't offer good features in lower models but is priced very competitively. The SUV market in India is growing and if MG Hector is rightly priced (say 13 lakhs onwards), it will be a definite Winner."
This is the best car. The looks are attractive. The features are amazing. 
An outstanding car much awaited for Indian market would have a tough rivalry with Tata Harrier wherein cost shall be a constraint too though stand out features are true attraction and out of segment compared to any car of this segment. MG is the first launch in the Indian market so eyes shall be a focus on quality with the price factor. Hands-on experience shall decide the actual impression.
"One of the best launches of foreign brands in India with its epic style and amazing looks. Also, the car would be reliable."
"It's the best car ever in whatever I saw SUV. Best in all features. Very good technology at all. Just amazing. Very stylish very comfortable. Looking good auto car. Best in all SUV very great to me I have. Super stylish car. And it?s display, and voice recognition system is amazing. Mobile technology is also a good"
"MG Hector is the best car in the budget. Car is fully based on future. The new feature is added a voice command is very nice. In this price MG has given a more featured car Hector, I like it."
"At last MG hector fulfilled all the requirements of modern SUV which are left by Tata Harrier...improved engine 173bhp..panoramic sunroof, with voice commands. Eagerly waiting for test drive."
Best package in this segment. This car is first 10.4 inch (0.26 m) touchscreen car mast build quality is best and safety features are also best to like 6 airbags.
More photos of interior require and the car should be automatic Overall it is outstanding in styles
"Looks great and model I like the headlights, and tail light, waiting to see on the road super excited."
"Impressed by the overall package. Looks are great, latest technology being used, various first time features on offer. Looking forward to owning this car as soon as possible."
My favourite upcoming car I like the assistant of MG quite updated as compared to its competitor Tata Harrier I am eagerly waiting for its to get it to launch.
"The Car is so Nice and fully loved than other cars. Love it .. Car looks so beautiful the design, and the price is not so high with these features. The first time I see that we can handle the car with our mobile phone.....Awesome Car."
Love the car but the tires should be bigger. The alloys can be improved as well.
"MG Hector looks bigger than the other SUVs. Great features, regarding style and security. It has a 360-degree parking camera and Ismart mobile application. Waiting for this awesome car. What should be the price of MG Hector?"
"Impressed by the overall package. Looks are great, latest technology being used, various first time features on offer. Looking forward to owning this car as soon as possible."
"It very good but it has 5 seating only it better than all cars, I think some smart features also available in coming seven-seaters car means it will be the best car of the budget, and.it will be the best car of that released year? Thank you for reading this review."
MG will make Boom in Automobile sector... Again. Fully feature loaded with a power pack performance.
"#Features of this car is excellent.... #Look of this car is very good.... #Infotainment system of this car is best as compared to another car of this range... #Production video which I have seen, in that video, this company produces a car in a very systematic way as compared to other companies.... #Overall, I loved this car!!!"
"Looks a sturdy and smart car. Kudos MG and More power. Hope it remains the same, and looking forward to making a buying choice soon after launch."
I think this car will be going to destroy all Indian cars. We are all waiting for the launch. Best of luck guys.
"Not Experienced but looking good, exterior and lighting is good, MG logo nice, double ton lighting is good"
I am damn sure that this masterpiece is going to be a show stealer. Bundled with plenty of high-end technological features. MG should cautiously fix the price if they really want to have their presence.
It will be the best ever SUV come to India market. Loved the configuration and advertisement. I am eagerly waiting for a test ride.
MG looks impressive and will dominate the segment. Need to check the engine performance. Diesel Automatic should be there.
Good design and nice looking car .it will bring a new lifestyle in the Indian car market. I hope it will be the new best SUV.
"MG Hector will beat the competition, best in the class at affordable prices."
"supercar no one knows in India someone knows the car is super it like a data harrier but awesome and supercar but car should come to market then only it can be sold and people are coming to buying they should be a surprise or a chocolate box to be given, and who is there to explain they should feel like a nice car, and the teller should be explained with an experienced person MG Hector."

Its length is more than as Comapred to the other cars of its competitors. It is going to rock in this segment. I think this is a perfect car for your money if you are looking for a mid-size SUV."
Love it MG you are so awesome and attractive cool outstanding gorgeous.
"Look like an American SUV, impressive looks tough and rough. I will not purchase any car before I try Hector."
Much Awaited car with these features. Hope automatically are not priced on a higher end. hope they maintain as many as service centers are opened.....
"I am really impressed. I really love this car, its specifications are really amazing and this car will be the best SUV in India, amazing features, good design really powerful engine, best voice assistance, good camera. And available at a very low price, this car will beat all the cars at its launch. "

It's going to be the biggest rival of Creta and XUV300. It's going to roar in June. It give panoramic biggest sunroof till now.
This is a superb car. I really like it. The looks are very impressive. 
It will be a great car for Indians who are going with Creta and other SUV cars .. great features as compared to all SUV VARIANTS
Advanced technology will pull it further if price will be aggressive in money minded market. All the best morris garage
"When I hear that car is coming to India which will be the first Indian electric SUV, I am surprised about that. This car's look is not so crispy as much as Tata's harrier, but it damns electric beast. This car doesn't shine us, this car speaks to us. Every Indian should purchase all car from MG brands only even though they are Chinese owned, reason that MG is an electric car. At least Indian pollution will be reduced instead of Globalisation of car trading across the world. If Tesla comes to Indian Market it will take 250% more import charge as much as 85 lakh rupees for just 25 lakh rupees tesla in the US states. Hats off to China for doing something changes to Indian environment. The reason why I am supporting China. Indians don't have the hope to produce own electric car even they are electrical engineers and the other hand government don't provide fund for an electric vehicle startup project. They don't care about success. But MG does. It provides their SUV not sedan in just between 15 to 20 lakh. I hope I may be the first customer. Thinking you. Yours, Pratik Bagale Founder of Rakalp Giant."
So good looks and voice control is an amazing feature. The LED day time running lights are very cool.
"Best SUV I have ever seen in this price range Good system,  design, good looking, worth money loved it MG."
This looks a new generation car with well equipped features and stylish curves sexy front grill and also gives us a feeling of James bond like to catch it from everywhere I love the way they advertise their car India its impressive to control the car from phone and words I appreciate Morris garage to launch such type of beautiful car in India.

"MG Hector is really a nice car, I will surely buy it. Looks are amazing, features are superb and I am excited to see this on road."
"Creative design, innovative approach to the Indian market, a tough competitor of Jeep Compass and Tata Harrier. The technology used by MG has also enhanced its performance in the Indian market, it's length is more than it's competitors, it's going to rock in this segment. I think this is a perfect car for your money if you are looking for a mid-size SUV."
"A very good competitor for Mahindra XUV 500, Jeep Compass, Tata Hexa and Renault Duster...Hope will get a good market in India too."

This is an amazing car. I think the best car in the current time. I love this car. This car is my dream car.
"The car shows its personality by its different and fantastic features. A person can fall in love with Hector. so please be careful. Need to see that the car shows its limiting because of high clearance. The car doesn't become SUV by its name, it becomes by its features. I just love the car. I think the car will fail the other SUVs. So other companies should be aware."
"It's awesome looks nails. Its presence on the road and aftermarket features are mind-boggling. I would like to buy this car. It's an artificial intelligence mixed with the car. But still, it misses out many things at this price point as compared to Jeep Compass. But still, it's more than enough. The colors offered by the company are awesome and really looks good on the car with large alloy wheels. This car will take attention of a lot of people on the road. We're waiting for this car."
"This is what we've been waiting for. Bring it on MG. A segment killer, with all that technology, petrol-Hybrid, Dual Clutch. Oh, and did I mention the Panoramic Sunroof and the 360degree camera on offer along with the embedded eSIM."
"Excellent car ever I like this car, and it differs from other XUV cars..its projector headlamps are awesome and interior too."
Masculine look and the features listed with that in given price range are attractive. Not sure about after sales service. Would like to know more after service and presence in India.
Mg hector is a stunning car. Better than I thought. Nice exterior and interior of the car. A good safety system. The car is coming soon on the floor and we are eagerly waiting for this beauty.
"Seems to be the value of money of buying MG Hector... Price range is a bit matter of concern. It gives a tough competition to Creta, Compass and XUV 500. The new arrival of mg may face some problems with to reach for remote area and small cities. One more thing to concerns that about service centers location. Hope for good."

Red MG Hector looks like a Red Angel in the very first look. Probably the best premium SUV with exquisite features launched in India so far. Will be proud to have one. MG with years of reputation in the automotive sector will definitely turn into a huge success in the Indian subcontinent as it is offering more than best automobile than rivals. Thank you.
"It will be a very good car and a tough competitor for mid-size SUVs and I am looking forward to buy it and praying that MG should come up with diesel automatic variant. If they come up with diesel automatic variant. I will be definitely buying that car, so lets see what happens at the launch of this beast."
"Excellent car. Looking forward to a nice experience, loved it. Should be low priced, so that even low budget people can buy it and have a luxurious experience and hence hoping that MG Hector becomes successful. Waiting for more models like this and especially sedans."
Nice choice to take a car which can give an amazing luxurious feel at a very low price. It can give a tough competition between the SUV cars.

A lovely looking car with superb features expected. Am sure they will load the car with lots of features and I have seen the review of the Indonesian 'Wuling Almaz'. It is the same as the upcoming MG Hector. I really hope they price it right and provide a diesel automatic right from the launch itself.

"What a car!! I am waiting for this excellent, nice to be seen on the roads."

"This car would be a great demand in the future. The looks are too awesome, the tail lights are in such a shape it would attract your look towards it. The shape of the hood and bumpers are awesome and 17 lakhs is a very good and affordable price for such a great car. It will meet your all expectations. I hope you like my review."

"I like this car's look and features as well. At this price, this is going to be a tough competitor for other cars of the same segment."
"The car's rear has average looks. Could have been more stylish & appealing. Headlamps should have been made more attractive like in latest SUVs of Land Rover & Range Rover's. All sides looks should have been out of the box, which is a requirement of this time."

MG Hector is a great looking car. It has given a nice finishing and the back look of the car is attractive. 
MG Hector is a very good car but its price must be reduced. Car looks modern feature packed but the cost is above the middle class can afford to purchase.
It will be a nice car in the future with a new brand in the Indian market.
